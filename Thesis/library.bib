@article{Cowley2008,
abstract = {In the domain of computer games, research into the interaction between player and game has centred on 'enjoyment', often drawing in particular on optimal experience research and Csikszentmihalyi's 'Flow theory'. Flow is a well-established construct for examining experience in any setting and its application to game-play is intuitive. Nevertheless, it's not immediately obvious how to translate between the flow construct and an operative description of game-play. Previous research has attempted this translation through analogy. In this article we propose a practical, integrated approach for analysis of the mechanics and aesthetics of game-play, which helps develop deeper insights into the capacity for flow within games. The relationship between player and game, characterized by learning and enjoyment, is central to our analysis. We begin by framing that relationship within Cowley's user-system-experience (USE) model, and expand this into an information systems framework, which enables a practical mapping of flow onto game-play. We believe this approach enhances our understanding of a player's interaction with a game and provides useful insights for games' researchers seeking to devise mechanisms to adapt game-play to individual players.},

@article{Brusilovsky2001,
abstract = {Traditional online dental education courses follow the broadcast paradigm which centers on the teacher, not the student. This one-size-fits-all approach resembles a mass-production idea which cannot take individual learner characteristics into account. Most online course designs do not address the issue that users with different goals and knowledge may be interested in different pieces of information about a topic. Adaptive hypermedia (AH) is an emerging field in education research which investigates how computer systems can overcome this problem. AH can be applied to any course content. This learner-centered approach first considers the learning goal(s), then evaluates the user's abilities and determines the individual learning style, to structure and tailor the curriculum most efficiently. The presented AH environment exploits various concepts of AH. The system collects data to create a model of the individual user, which is continuously refined based on test results throughout the course. The system then adapts the learning material dynamically, using active and passive curriculum sequencing and adaptive presentation.},

@article{Webb2011,
abstract = {Introduction: Comorbidity is an important determinant of survival for renal replacement therapy patients and impacts other care processes such as dialysis access creation and transplant wait-listing. The prevalence of comorbidities in incident patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT) changes with age and varies between ethnic groups. This study describes these associations and the independent effect of comorbidities on outcomes. Methods: Incident patients reported to the UK Renal Registry (UKRR) with comorbidity data in 2008 and 2009 (n = 5,617) were included in analyses exploring the association of comorbidity with patient demographics, treatment modality, haemoglobin and renal function at start of RRT. For analyses examining comorbidity and survival, adult patients starting RRT between 2004 and 2009 in centres reporting to the UKRR with comorbidity data (n = 16,527) were included. The relationship between comorbidities and mortality at 90 days and one year after 90 days from start of RRT was explored using Cox regression. Results: Completeness of comorbidity data was 44.4\% in 2009 compared with 52.1\% in 2004. Of patients with data, 56.5\% had one or more comorbidities. Diabetes mellitus and ischaemic heart disease were the most common conditions seen in 32.9\% and 22.5\% of patients respectively. Current smoking was recorded for 12.4\% of incident RRT patients in the 2-year period. The presence of comorbidities in patients <75 years became more common with increasing age in all ethnic groups. In multivariable survival analysis, malignancy and the presence of ischaemic/neuropathic ulcers were the strongest independent predictors of poor survival at 1 year after 90 days from the start of RRT in patients <65 years. Conclusion: Differences in prevalence rates of comorbid illnesses in incident RRT patients may reflect variation in access to health care or competing risk prior to commencing treatment. The interpretation of analyses continues to be limited by poor data completeness.},

@article{Tsandilas2004,
abstract = {Adaptive interfaces have received a lot of criticism as adaptation and automatic assistance contradict with the principles of direct-manipulation interfaces. In addition to this, their success highly depends on the ability of user models to capture the goals and needs of the users. Since the construction of user models is often based on poor evidence, even the most advanced learning algorithms may fail to accurately predict the user goals. Previous research has not put much effort on investigating the usability problems that adaptive systems engage and developing interaction techniques that could resolve these problems. This paper presents an interaction model for Adaptive Hypermedia which merges adaptive support and direct manipulation. This approach is build upon a new content adaptation technique which derives from fisheye views. This adaptation technique supports incremental and continuous adjustments of the adaptive views of hypermedia documents and balances between focus and context. By combining this technique with visual representations and controllers of user models, we formed a twofold interaction model which enables users to quickly move between adaptation and direct control.},

abstract = {Most current serious games suffer from system inflexibility, which is responsible for stereotyped training scenarios and predictable game-play. My goal is to support adaptivity in serious games by allowing virtual scenarios to dynamically adjust to what and how players should learn. Adaptivity should give players more effective gaming and learning experiences, if it is guided by their Instructors' knowledge about both players and learning goals. I expect to enable Instructors to create adaptive scenarios through specification of: what players have to learn, how they should learn it and, afterwards, what went missing. This work focuses on embedding this sort of knowledge into objects of the virtual scenario, through new semantic modeling methods. Meaningful information on what to learn will be solved into generating pre-game scenarios. How to learn knowledge will be used to create in-game adaptable objects and events. Assessments on what went missing will be solved to re-generate post-game (try again) scenarios.},

With high-tech equipments we are able to bring novel experience to learners. Both of game-based learning strategies are with their own advantages. However, the previous difficulty of game-based learning is to integrate these two kinds of learning strategies and strike a balance between them. Therefore, this study aims to utilize activity theory as an analytics tool to analyze the factors of each game-based learning status. After the analysis, we discussed the contradiction of each activity system. Furthermore we had also some suggestions for the instructors and learning activity designers to make game-based learning more useful and meaningful.},

Particularly, a number of authors have been investigating approaches to extend the expressivity beyond what is currently supported by the DL (Description Logics) based languages in order to address this issue, while maintaining compatibility with subclasses of DLs adopted in the Semantic Web. This is mainly due to the increasing popularity of the Semantic Web initiative as well as the role played by DL in that context. In this paper we defend the need of a higher-level foundational framework based on results coming from the discipline of Formal Ontology. We present two complementary proposals for modeling temporally changing information in OWL, based on the most discussed strategy in the literature to address this problem, namely, the use of a perdurantist (or 4D) view of domain entities. Moreover we compare the results with some related work and discuss its limitations and further improvements.},

abstract = {It is argued that digital games, including simulations and virtual worlds, have the potential to be an important teaching tool because they are interactive, engaging and immersive activities (for example see the work of Gee 2008; Shaffer 2005; Smith 2007). This document considers this claim. It begins by briefly considering the rationale for using games in education informal and formal. It then considers the various types of digital games that are described as being educational, specifically: the relationship between games, serious games, simulations, educational simulations, and virtual worlds the definition and usefulness of the term serious games the underlying pedagogy in education games assessment within games. The report then has an overview of their current use and research around their usage in multiple environments: the military, health, informal, vocational and formal education settings. It looks at the challenges of embedding serious games in formal education and three current methods for assessing appropriateness and effectiveness of games for teaching. From this it argues that what is required is a toolkit for educators, game designers and policy makers that allows the design and assessment of games to be used with an educational goal.},

@article{Kickmeier-Rust2006a,
abstract = {Digital game-based learning is a hot topic of research and development. Since the advent of computer and video games, educators were inherently interested in utilizing the beneficial aspects of computer games for educational purposes. These factors are primarily the intrinsic motivation of games, immersive environments, engaging stories, and an artful balance between challenges and continuously growing abilities. Proponents of computer games delivered a large number of empirical investigations revealing that games may foster the development of abilities and competencies. Besides the advantageous aspects of computer games, a variety of problems were reported by researchers. Due to the high costs of professional game development, many educational games are technologically poor and cannot compete with entertainment games in terms of visual design, possibilities for interactions, or storytelling. Moreover, many current educational games do not incorporate a sound psychological, pedagogical, or didactic background; instead they are focusing on transmission or rehearsal of isolated facts or skills. Finally, such games lack the ability to adapt to individual competencies failing to balance challenge and abilities regarding knowledge or skills. The ELEKTRA project, introduced in this article, aims for addressing these problems relying on an interdisciplinary approach of cognitive science, neuroscience, pedagogy, game design, and game development. The project will develop an adventure game that can keep up with commercial games and that focuses on primarily curriculum-related educational purposes by incorporating a sound psychological and pedagogical framework. Moreover, the project will prove the outcomes of research and development by a comprehensive game demonstrator.},

They suggest an alternative approach supporting the use of the naturalistic paradigm.},

@inproceedings{Henderson2006,
abstract = {The current buzz-word in the e-Learning community is game-based learning or serious gamesgames whose primary focus is education not entertainment. Until recently, much e-Learning consisted of page-turner lessons created in an attempt to fill the growing demand for online courses. However, e-Learning is moving beyond merely digitizing traditional classroom course content for online accessibility. These serious games are becoming the new model for e-Learning. A good game, including a serious game, consists of a story, a clear goal, a significant yet not impossible challenge, meaningful actions, and appropriate feedback all rolled up in an attention-getting package. A challenge for instructional designers in creating these serious games is changing our mindset from the traditional presentation of the lesson followed by testing to assess student comprehension. These lessons are typically in text format followed by a multiple choice test. Even when we try to jazz it up with graphics and interactivity, it is still the same old thing. In creating games, we need to move away from putting text on a screen to creating engaging learning experiences. So, how do we make the transition from instructional designers to serious game designers? What do instructional designers need to do differently? This paper describes the challenges and lessons learned in designing two game-based courses for the U.S. Army. Weve had to adapt everything from storyboarding to the changing roles of the development team members. instructional designers need to know how games work and how to keep the educational objective from being obscured by the entertainment and glitz of the game.},

More specifically, we provided paper media, keyboards, pen tablets, and tablet PCs as input devices used for annotations during e-learning, measured the gaze point of each learner by an eye-mark recorder, and evaluated each device by setting memory and comprehension tests, giving questionnaires, and evaluating the note-taking. As a result, we have shown that the use of tablet PCs in e-learning 1) enables concentration on the content, 2) reduces the extraneous cognitive load imposed by making annotations, 3) increases learners' comprehension and memory retention, and 4) enables efficient note-taking, thus increasing the accuracy of notes as learning aids.},

With high-tech equipments we are able to bring novel experience to learners. Both of game-based learning strategies are with their own advantages. However, the previous difficulty of game-based learning is to integrate these two kinds of learning strategies and strike a balance between them. Therefore, this study aims to utilize activity theory as an analytics tool to analyze the factors of each game-based learning status. After the analysis, we discussed the contradiction of each activity system. Furthermore we had also some suggestions for the instructors and learning activity designers to make game-based learning more useful and meaningful.},

abstract = {The current buzz-word in the e-Learning community is game-based learning or serious gamesgames whose primary focus is education not entertainment. Until recently, much e-Learning consisted of page-turner lessons created in an attempt to fill the growing demand for online courses. However, e-Learning is moving beyond merely digitizing traditional classroom course content for online accessibility. These serious games are becoming the new model for e-Learning. A good game, including a serious game, consists of a story, a clear goal, a significant yet not impossible challenge, meaningful actions, and appropriate feedback all rolled up in an attention-getting package. A challenge for instructional designers in creating these serious games is changing our mindset from the traditional presentation of the lesson followed by testing to assess student comprehension. These lessons are typically in text format followed by a multiple choice test. Even when we try to jazz it up with graphics and interactivity, it is still the same old thing. In creating games, we need to move away from putting text on a screen to creating engaging learning experiences. So, how do we make the transition from instructional designers to serious game designers? What do instructional designers need to do differently? This paper describes the challenges and lessons learned in designing two game-based courses for the U.S. Army. Weve had to adapt everything from storyboarding to the changing roles of the development team members. instructional designers need to know how games work and how to keep the educational objective from being obscured by the entertainment and glitz of the game.},

@article{Kickmeier-Rust2006a,
abstract = {Digital game-based learning is a hot topic of research and development. Since the advent of computer and video games, educators were inherently interested in utilizing the beneficial aspects of computer games for educational purposes. These factors are primarily the intrinsic motivation of games, immersive environments, engaging stories, and an artful balance between challenges and continuously growing abilities. Proponents of computer games delivered a large number of empirical investigations revealing that games may foster the development of abilities and competencies. Besides the advantageous aspects of computer games, a variety of problems were reported by researchers. Due to the high costs of professional game development, many educational games are technologically poor and cannot compete with entertainment games in terms of visual design, possibilities for interactions, or storytelling. Moreover, many current educational games do not incorporate a sound psychological, pedagogical, or didactic background; instead they are focusing on transmission or rehearsal of isolated facts or skills. Finally, such games lack the ability to adapt to individual competencies failing to balance challenge and abilities regarding knowledge or skills. The ELEKTRA project, introduced in this article, aims for addressing these problems relying on an interdisciplinary approach of cognitive science, neuroscience, pedagogy, game design, and game development. The project will develop an adventure game that can keep up with commercial games and that focuses on primarily curriculum-related educational purposes by incorporating a sound psychological and pedagogical framework. Moreover, the project will prove the outcomes of research and development by a comprehensive game demonstrator.},

This document considers this claim. It begins by briefly considering the rationale for using games in education informal and formal. It then considers the various types of digital games that are described as being educational, specifically: the relationship between games, serious games, simulations, educational simulations, and virtual worlds the definition and usefulness of the term serious games the underlying pedagogy in education games assessment within games. The report then has an overview of their current use and research around their usage in multiple environments: the military, health, informal, vocational and formal education settings. It looks at the challenges of embedding serious games in formal education and three current methods for assessing appropriateness and effectiveness of games for teaching. From this it argues that what is required is a toolkit for educators, game designers and policy makers that allows the design and assessment of games to be used with an educational goal.},

@article{Webb2011,
abstract = {Introduction: Comorbidity is an important determinant of survival for renal replacement therapy patients and impacts other care processes such as dialysis access creation and transplant wait-listing. The prevalence of comorbidities in incident patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT) changes with age and varies between ethnic groups. This study describes these associations and the independent effect of comorbidities on outcomes. Methods: Incident patients reported to the UK Renal Registry (UKRR) with comorbidity data in 2008 and 2009 (n = 5,617) were included in analyses exploring the association of comorbidity with patient demographics, treatment modality, haemoglobin and renal function at start of RRT. For analyses examining comorbidity and survival, adult patients starting RRT between 2004 and 2009 in centres reporting to the UKRR with comorbidity data (n = 16,527) were included. The relationship between comorbidities and mortality at 90 days and one year after 90 days from start of RRT was explored using Cox regression. Results: Completeness of comorbidity data was 44.4\% in 2009 compared with 52.1\% in 2004. Of patients with data, 56.5\% had one or more comorbidities. Diabetes mellitus and ischaemic heart disease were the most common conditions seen in 32.9\% and 22.5\% of patients respectively. Current smoking was recorded for 12.4\% of incident RRT patients in the 2-year period. The presence of comorbidities in patients <75 years became more common with increasing age in all ethnic groups. In multivariable survival analysis, malignancy and the presence of ischaemic/neuropathic ulcers were the strongest independent predictors of poor survival at 1 year after 90 days from the start of RRT in patients <65 years. Conclusion: Differences in prevalence rates of comorbid illnesses in incident RRT patients may reflect variation in access to health care or competing risk prior to commencing treatment. The interpretation of analyses continues to be limited by poor data completeness.},

We suggest that not only is it timely for significant AI innovation but that it is essential to appreciably enhance key interactive aspects of digital game design, create opportunities for novel gameplay scenarios, and to progress the medium as an art form. Issues arising from the enhanced utilization of AI in digital games are discussed and the implications for gameplay explored; such as affecting player emotion, moral dilemmas, player created stories, dynamic and adaptive game worlds, and character believability.},

abstract = {Web systems suffer from an inability to satisfy the heterogeneous needs of many users. For example, Web courses present the same static learning material to students with widely differing knowledge of the subject. Web e-stores offer the same selection of "featured items" to customers with different needs and preferences. Virtual museums on the Web offer the same "guided tour" to visitors with very different goals and interests. Health information sites present the same information to readers with different health problems. A remedy for the negative effects of the traditional "one-size-fits-all" approach is to develop systems with an ability to adapt their behavior to the goals, tasks, interests, and other features of individual users and groups of users. The Adaptive Web is a relatively young research area. Starting with a few pioneering works on adaptive hypertext in early 1990, it now attracts many researchers from different communities such as hypertext, user modeling, machine learning, natural language generation, information retrieval, intelligent tutoring systems, cognitive science, and Web-based education.},

abstract = {Little attention has been given to the psychological and sociological value of play despite its many advantages to guiding the design of interactive multimedia learning environments for children and adults. This paper provides a brief overview of the history, research, and theory related to play. Research from education, psychology, and anthropology suggests that play is a powerful mediator for learning throughout a person's life. The time has come to couple the ever increasing processing capabilities of computers with the advantages of play. The design of hybrid interactive learning environments is suggested based on the constructivist concept of a microworld and supported with elements of both games and simulations.},

mathematical concepts. One of the underlying motivations for the AquaMOOSE project is to
leverage the entertainment value of video games to provide a learning environment that engages
students in more meaningful ways than are typically seen in the classroom. In this quasiexperimental
comparison class study at a suburban high school, we compared the AquaMOOSE
intervention to instruction using the traditional curriculum. Our results were disappointing, and
call into question our underlying assumptions. In this paper, we will describe factors that
contributed and discuss broader implications. Student expectations for the software were high due
to the production values seen in commercial video games. In addition, the 3D aspect of the
AquaMOOSE software introduced usability concerns and increased content complexity. We also
encountered many classic problems of research in the classroom that affected the outcome of the

The most consistent finding of this research has been that trainees do not make good instructional use of the control they are given. Yet, today's technologically based training systems often provide individuals with significant control over their learning (Brown, 2001). This creates a dilemma that must be addressed if technology is going to be used to create more effective training systems. The current study extended past research that has examined the effects of providing trainees with some form of advisement or guidance in addition to learner control and examined the impact of an instructional strategy, adaptive guidance, on learning and performance in a complex training environment. Overall, it was found that adaptive guidance had a substantial effect on the nature of trainees' study and practice, self-regulation, knowledge acquired, and performance.},

We present a framework for creating interactive narratives for entertainment, educational, and training purposes based on a type of agent called an experience manager. An experience manager (a generalization of a drama manager) is an intelligent computer agent that manipulates a virtual world to coerce a participant’s experience to conform to a set of provided properties. Our realization of the experience manager automatically generates narrative content in order to adapt to the user’s actions in the virtual world. The experience management framework has been used to develop an interactive version of Little Red Riding Hood and an interactive practice environment called IN-TALE for educating and training cognitive skills such as situation awareness, cultural awareness, leadership, and decisionmaking.},

The NUCLEO system combines two approaches grounded in the constructive pedagogical stream, the Computer Supported Collaborative Learning and the Problem Based Learning, with the engaging and immersive formats of the videogames. It provides a futurist scenario in which students (represented by avatars and organized in small teams) have to collaborate to solve a learning mission following the mechanics of a classical role based play. In order to increase the efficiency of the collaborative work and to reduce the teacher's workload, NUCLEO applies user modeling techniques to the studentspsila learning strategies, considering a simplified framework of Vermunt's model for learning styles. The model determines how the system brings together students whose learning strategies are complementary to build up collaborative and semi-autonomous learning teams. Examples from an ongoing study with NUCLEO to teach programming disciplines illustrate the presentation of these adaptation models.},

In this paper, we describe an innovative concept of three-dimensional interactive educational games that combine the excitement and looks of popular computer games with the educational potential of electronic study materials. One of the key issues is adaptability (games are also playable by handicapped users) and adaptivity according to learners' level of knowledge. Together with automatic generation of educational games based on metadata provided by authors of educational materials, we enable the creation of educational games that have many shapes reflecting learners' needs.},

abstract = {One of the major obstacles in developing quality eLearning content is the substantial development costs involved and development time required [12]. Educational providers, such as those in the university sector and corporate learning, are under increasing pressure to enhance the pedagogical quality and technical richness of their course offerings while at the same time achieving improved return on investment. One means of enhancing the educational impact of eLearning courses, while still optimizing the return on investment, is to facilitate the personalization and repurposing of learning objects across multiple related courses. However, eLearning courses typically differ strongly in ethos, learning goals and pedagogical approach whilst learners, even within the same course, may have different personal learning goals, motivations, prior knowledge and learning style preferences. This paper proposes an innovative multi-model approach to the dynamic composition and delivery of personalized learning utilizing reusable learning objects. The paper describes an adaptive metadata driven engine that composes, at runtime, tailored educational experiences across a single content base. This paper presents the theoretical models, design and implementation of the adaptive hypermedia educational service. This service is currently being successfully used for the delivery of undergraduate degree courses in Trinity College, Dublin as well as being used as part of a major EU research trial.},

abstract = {Educational software games aim at increasing the students' motivation and engagement while they learn. However, if software games are targeted to school classrooms they have to be usable and likeable by all students. Usability of virtual reality games may be a problem because these games tend to have complex user interfaces so that they are more attractive. Moreover, if the games acquire an educational content they may lose the attractiveness and appeal that they have on users who are familiar with commercial games. Consequently, likeability may also be questioned. This paper addresses the issue of usability and likeability of a virtual reality game that is meant to teach students geography. The authors describe the evaluation experiments conducted, which involved three categories of students in terms of their level of game-playing expertise: novice, intermediate and expert game players. The evaluation results showed that the game was indeed usable and likeable but there was scope for usability and likeability improvement so that the educational benefits may be maximised for all categories of students. The evaluation studies reported in this paper, revealed important issues about further research on virtual reality educational games.},

abstract = {The Tactical Language and Culture Training System (TLCTS) helps learners acquire basic communicative skills in foreign languages and cultures. Learners acquire communication skills through a combination of interactive lessons and serious games. Artificial intelligence plays multiple roles in this learning environment: to process the learner’s speech, to interpret and evaluate learner actions, to control the response of non-player characters, to generate hints, and to assess the trainee’s mastery of the skills. AI is also used to assist in the authoring process to assist in the generation and validation of lesson content. This paper gives an overview of the current system, and describes the experience to date in transitioning the system from research prototype into a training system that is in regular use by thousands of users in the United States and elsewhere.},

This paper explores how the Serious Games approach can be exploited to create skills in dealing with cross-cultural issues in project management. The degree of difference this can make to real-world performance is so dramatic that managers who have experienced it are seeing it not as a way to add Incremental Improvements to TEL (Technology Enhanced Learning) but as more of a Radical Innovation – a revolutionary change. Some of the main skills required in project management are reviewed, and different models of cross-cultural analysis applied to understand how the challenges of managing projects are increased by cultural issues. Our testbed for this is an EU project TARGET that is developing the next generation TEL approach. We describe its approach and look at how the TARGET serious game can be designed to achieve enhanced cross-cultural skills in users.},

  core of the methodology can be summarized by the ELEKTRA’s 4Ms: Macroadaptivity, Microadaptivity, Metacognition, and Motivation.
  The conceptual framework is structured in eight phases which have several interconnections and feedback-cycles that enable

The challenges faced when introducing a video game into a classroom are twofold: overcoming the notion that a "toy" does not belong in the school and developing software that has real educational value while stimulating the learner. We conducted an initial pilot study with 39 second grade students using our mathematic drill software Skills Arena. Early data from the pilot suggests that not only do teachers and students enjoy using Skills Arena, students have exceeded our expectations by doing three times more math problems in 19 days than they would have using traditional worksheets. Based on this encouraging qualitative study, future work that focuses on quantitative benefits should likely uncover additional positive results.},

However, this is not to suggest that HCI has little to offer the game design community. Indeed, the exact opposite appears to be true. A number of user-centred design techniques have evolved which can support each stage of the game design process, from concept through to post-production. However, there is currently no archive of appropriate techniques showing how they might be applied to videogame design. Given the differences in goals from these products to traditional software, this is clearly necessary. The purpose of this workshop is to identify those techniques appropriate to game design, and elicit practitioners' experience when applying such methodologies. The intended result is a prescriptive process which demonstrates how user-centred methodologies can best be applied to game design. },

The use of software agents has been advocated as a means to deal with the complexity of serious games. Current approaches to dynamic adjustability in games make it possible for different elements to adjust to the player. However, these approaches most use centralized control, which becomes impractical if the complexity and the number of adaptable elements increase. The serious games we are investigating are constructed using complex and independent subtasks that influence each other. In this paper, we propose a model for game adaptation that is guided by three main concerns: the trainee, the game objectives and the agents. In particular we focus on how the adaptation engine determines tasks to be adapted and how agents respond to such requests and modify their plans accordingly.},

abstract = {Educational software games aim at increasing the students' motivation and engagement while they learn. However, if software games are targeted to school classrooms they have to be usable and likeable by all students. Usability of virtual reality games may be a problem because these games tend to have complex user interfaces so that they are more attractive. Moreover, if the games acquire an educational content they may lose the attractiveness and appeal that they have on users who are familiar with commercial games. Consequently, likeability may also be questioned. This paper addresses the issue of usability and likeability of a virtual reality game that is meant to teach students geography. The authors describe the evaluation experiments conducted, which involved three categories of students in terms of their level of game-playing expertise: novice, intermediate and expert game players. The evaluation results showed that the game was indeed usable and likeable but there was scope for usability and likeability improvement so that the educational benefits may be maximised for all categories of students. The evaluation studies reported in this paper, revealed important issues about further research on virtual reality educational games.},

abstract = {E-learners require activities and content based on their preferences and prior knowledge, not merely fully static, page-turning sequences. In this paper we present a framework that integrates and supports two approaches towards adaptation to the learner needs -- design and runtime adaptation. The framework is based on IMS Learning Design (IMS LD). IMS LD offers a semantic notation to describe an educational scenario in a formal way. At design time a teacher or a design team can create or inspect a learning design model and use it in multiple courses. At runtime a tutor or agent, an autonomous piece of software, can interpret a learning design and students' progress and subsequent take action while a course is in progress, e.g. make suggestions to learners. We will discuss the study that lead to the framework, and explain the role of IMS LD and the promising role of agents in adaptive e-learning.

contributed and discuss broader implications. Student expectations for the software were high due
to the production values seen in commercial video games. In addition, the 3D aspect of the

The purpose of the paper is to operationalize the dimensions of flow experience in an educational game context and to test a constructed GameFlow questionnaire. Furthermore, the study strives to validate flow antecedents, the factors contributing to flow experience, proposed in game design models such as the experiential gaming model. The flow antecedents and the GameFlow questionnaire were studied through a business simulation game, which was used in a university level course (N = 92). Results indicate that the flow antecedents studied contributed to the flow experience and should be considered in educational game design. Furthermore, the results provided some baseline evidence for the assumption that flow experience has a positive impact on learning. Overall, these results indicate that the experiential gaming model and the GameFlow questionnaire are useful tools for studying gaming experience and can be used in educational game design.

abstract = {Most current serious games suffer from system inflexibility, which is responsible for stereotyped training scenarios and predictable game-play. My goal is to support adaptivity in serious games by allowing virtual scenarios to dynamically adjust to what and how players should learn. Adaptivity should give players more effective gaming and learning experiences, if it is guided by their Instructors' knowledge about both players and learning goals. I expect to enable Instructors to create adaptive scenarios through specification of: what players have to learn, how they should learn it and, afterwards, what went missing. This work focuses on embedding this sort of knowledge into objects of the virtual scenario, through new semantic modeling methods. Meaningful information on what to learn will be solved into generating pre-game scenarios. How to learn knowledge will be used to create in-game adaptable objects and events. Assessments on what went missing will be solved to re-generate post-game (try again) scenarios.},

We illustrate how our probabilistic model assesses affect by integrating evidence on both possible causes of the user’s emotional arousal (i.e., the state of the interaction) and its effects (i.e., bodily expressions that are known to be influenced by emotional reactions). The probabilistic model relies on a Dynamic Decision Network to leverage any indirect evidence on the user’s emotional state, in order to estimate this state and any other related variable in the model. This is crucial in a modeling task in which the available evidence usually varies with the user and with each particular interaction. The probabilistic model we present is to be used by decision theoretic pedagogical agents to generate interventions aimed at achieving the best tradeoff between a user’s learning and engagement during the interaction with educational games.},

The NUCLEO system combines two approaches grounded in the constructive pedagogical stream, the Computer Supported Collaborative Learning and the Problem Based Learning, with the engaging and immersive formats of the videogames. It provides a futurist scenario in which students (represented by avatars and organized in small teams) have to collaborate to solve a learning mission following the mechanics of a classical role based play. In order to increase the efficiency of the collaborative work and to reduce the teacher's workload, NUCLEO applies user modeling techniques to the studentspsila learning strategies, considering a simplified framework of Vermunt's model for learning styles. The model determines how the system brings together students whose learning strategies are complementary to build up collaborative and semi-autonomous learning teams. Examples from an ongoing study with NUCLEO to teach programming disciplines illustrate the presentation of these adaptation models.},

abstract = {This paper details the central ideas to date, from a PhD entitled ‘Player Profiling for Adaptive Artificial Intelligence in
  Computer and Video Games’. Computer and videogames differ from other web and productivity software in that games are much
  more highly interactive and immersive experiences. Whereas usability and user modelling for other software may be based on
  productivity alone, games require an additional factor that takes account of the quality of the user experience in playing
  a game. In order to describe that experience we describe a model of User, System and Experience (USE) in which the primary
  construct for evaluation of a player’s experience will be the Experience Fluctuation Model (EFM), taken from Flow theory.
  We illustrate with a straightforward example how this system may be automated in real-time within a commercial game.},

The four approaches of static part-task approaches, static whole-task approaches, dynamic part-task approaches, and dynamic whole-task approaches are identified and compared in terms of their flexibility and adaptability to the needs of the individual trainee during training. The comparison shows that dynamic whole-task approaches are the most flexible and adaptive. For each approach it is discussed to what complex cognitive skills they might be useful training methods.},

abstract = {This paper describes a model-checking approach for adventure games focusing on  e-Adventure , a platform for the development of adaptive educational adventure videogames. In  e-Adventure , games are described using a domain-specific language oriented to game writers. By defining a translation from this language to suitable state-based models, it is possible to automatically extract a verification model for each  e-Adventure  game. In addition, temporal properties to be verified are described using an extensible assertion language, which can be tailored to each specific application scenario. When the framework determines that some of these properties do not hold, it generates an animation of a counterexample. This approach facilitates the collaboration of multidisciplinary teams of experts during the verification of the integrity of the game scripts, exchanging hours of manual verification for semi-automatic verification processes that also facilitate the diagnosis of the conditions that may potentially break the games.},

The educational game is a virtual reality adventure game that performs affective user modelling by measuring emotional characteristics of users. Virtual reality (VR) games are so popular among children and adolescents that can be used for the purposes of educational software to render it more attractive and motivating. The benefits of such an application can be maximised if it is available over the Web. Software applications that operate over the Web are targeted to a wide range of users. Hence they need a high degree of adaptivity and dynamic individualisation to each user that interacts with the application. This should include the students’ emotional state that affects their learning. However, the environment of a Web-based VR-game that performs user modelling is so demanding that the technology of Web services is necessary for its effective operation and interoperability. Moreover, reusability may be achieved for the user modelling component.},

The central component of the ISAT architecture is an intelligent director agent responsible for individualizing the training experience. To achieve this, the director tracks the trainee’s demonstration of knowledge and skills during the training experience. Using that information, the director plays a role similar to that of a schoolhouse trainer, customizing training scenarios to meet individual trainee needs. The director can react to trainee actions within a scenario, dynamically adapting the environment to the learning needs of trainee as well as the dramatic needs of the scene. This paper describes a prototype implementation of the ISAT architecture in the combat medic training domain, with an emphasis on the design of the director agent.},

Each learner is accompanied by a virtual aide who can provide assistance and guidance if needed, tailored to each learner’s individual skills. The aide can also act as a virtual tutor as part of an intelligent tutoring system, giving the learners feedback on their performance. Learners communicate via a multimodal interface, which permits them to speak and choose gestures on behalf of their character in the simulation.

abstract = {The increasing amount of new technologies (including multimedia, internet and virtual reality) allows us to use new approaches in design and implementation of applications of various kinds. Specific requirements emerge in the case of users with specific needs. One such example might be the use of 3D information in the web environment (and navigation in such an environment) by visually impaired users. Our solution provides semantic and functional description of the scene objects and inter-object relations in addition to "standard" geometric scene description. This approach permits the user to query for various information in the virtual environment (e.g. searching for a path to a specific object, searching for an object with specific properties and particularly filtering scene information). The system should allow the visually impaired user to virtually walk through the scene and query for information about the objects in a scene. In such a way they are able to obtain information that has been available to users without visual impairments. The user interface itself provides the feedback in accordance with the user's group's specific requirements - the feedback is implemented as a human readable text that can be simply accessed using one of the common accessibility tools (screen reader, Braille display etc.). The embedded module capable of providing speech output has also been implemented.},

We illustrate how our probabilistic model assesses affect by integrating evidence on both possible causes of the user’s emotional arousal (i.e., the state of the interaction) and its effects (i.e., bodily expressions that are known to be influenced by emotional reactions). The probabilistic model relies on a Dynamic Decision Network to leverage any indirect evidence on the user’s emotional state, in order to estimate this state and any other related variable in the model. This is crucial in a modeling task in which the available evidence usually varies with the user and with each particular interaction. The probabilistic model we present is to be used by decision theoretic pedagogical agents to generate interventions aimed at achieving the best tradeoff between a user’s learning and engagement during the interaction with educational games.},

This is not an easy objective to achieve and adaptive game technology, although a popular ideal in some quarters, is still fraught with difficulties and some controversy.

abstract = {Interactive drama is increasingly being used as a pedagogical tool in a wide variety of computer-based learning environments. However, the effort required to build interactive dramas is quite significant. We built Thespian, an architecture that supports faster development of IPDs, open-ended interaction, encoding of pedagogical goals and quantitative metrics for evaluating those goals. Thespian uses autonomous agents to control each character and assumes that the starting point for the design process is a set of standard scripts. A “fitting” algorithm facilitates the design process by automatically adjusting the goals of the agents so that the agents perform their roles according to the scripts. This also ensures the agents will behave true to their character’s motivations even when the interactive drama deviates from the scripts. In this paper, we discuss this basic approach in detail and illustrate its application to the Tactical Language Training System.},

Learners now have an opportunity to educate with the help of electronic materials often provided by web-based infrastructures. Although the majority of learners - especially children or teenagers - find studying from such materials less exciting than playing today's popular computer games that, however, lack signs of education. In this paper, we describe an innovative concept of three-dimensional interactive educational games that combine the excitement and looks of popular computer games with the educational potential of electronic study materials. One of the key issues is adaptability (games are also playable by handicapped users) and adaptivity according to learners' level of knowledge. Together with automatic generation of educational games based on metadata provided by authors of educational materials, we enable the creation of educational games that have many shapes reflecting learners' needs.},

abstract = {We are teaching a new generation of students, cradled in technologies, communication and abundance of information. The implications are that we need to focus the design of learning technologies to support social learning in context. Instead of designing technologies that ldquoteachrdquo the learner, the new social learning technologies will perform three main roles: 1) support the learner in finding the right content (right for the context, for the particular learner, for the specific purpose of the learner, right pedagogically); 2) support learners to connect with the right people (again right for the context, learner, purpose, educational goal etc.), and 3) motivate/incentivize people to learn. In the pursuit of such environments, new areas of sciences become relevant as a source of methods and techniques: social psychology, economic/game theory, multi-agent systems. The paper illustrates how social learning technologies can be designed using some existing and emerging technologies: ontologies vs. social tagging, exploratory search, collaborative vs. self-managed social recommendations, trust and reputation mechanisms, mechanism design and social visualization.},

abstract = {E-learners require activities and content based on their preferences and prior knowledge, not merely fully static, page-turning sequences. In this paper we present a framework that integrates and supports two approaches towards adaptation to the learner needs -- design and runtime adaptation. The framework is based on IMS Learning Design (IMS LD). IMS LD offers a semantic notation to describe an educational scenario in a formal way. At design time a teacher or a design team can create or inspect a learning design model and use it in multiple courses. At runtime a tutor or agent, an autonomous piece of software, can interpret a learning design and students' progress and subsequent take action while a course is in progress, e.g. make suggestions to learners. We will discuss the study that lead to the framework, and explain the role of IMS LD and the promising role of agents in adaptive e-learning.

abstract = {Although player enjoyment is central to computer games, there is currently no accepted model of player enjoyment in games. There are many heuristics in the literature, based on elements such as the game interface, mechanics, gameplay, and narrative. However, there is a need to integrate these heuristics into a validated model that can be used to design, evaluate, and understand enjoyment in games. We have drawn together the various heuristics into a concise model of enjoyment in games that is structured by flow. Flow, a widely accepted model of enjoyment, includes eight elements that, we found, encompass the various heuristics from the literature. Our new model, GameFlow, consists of eight elements -- concentration, challenge, skills, control, clear goals, feedback, immersion, and social interaction. Each element includes a set of criteria for achieving enjoyment in games. An initial investigation and validation of the GameFlow model was carried out by conducting expert reviews of two real-time strategy games, one high-rating and one low-rating, using the GameFlow criteria. The result was a deeper understanding of enjoyment in real-time strategy games and the identification of the strengths and weaknesses of the GameFlow model as an evaluation tool. The GameFlow criteria were able to successfully distinguish between the high-rated and low-rated games and identify why one succeeded and the other failed. We concluded that the GameFlow model can be used in its current form to review games; further work will provide tools for designing and evaluating enjoyment in games.},

Specifically, this analysis presents (a) an overview of the two primary elements in MMORPGs game design: character design and narrative environment, (b) a discussion of intrinsic motivation in character role-playing, (c) a discussion of intrinsic motivational supports and cognitive support of the narrative structure of small quests, and (d) a discussion of how the narrative structure of MMORPGs might foster learning in various types of knowledge.},

abstract = {A crucial factor for successful digital educational games, particularly for older children and adolescents, is an appropriate balance; balance between learning and gaming and balance between challenge and ability. These factors are important to maintain fun, immersion, flow experience, and motivation – the motivation to play and therefore to learn. Moreover, it is important to realize a gaming experience that can compete with that of commercial, non-educational games. A special challenge in this context arises from the need for pedagogical support during learning - and therefore during gaming. At many staves of the learning ladder, from a psych-pedagogical perspective, support and feedback is necessary in order to ensure successful, effective, and complacent learning. Considering the importance of not destroying immersion with the game, the assessment of the learning progress and psycho-pedagogical feedback must occur in a non-invasive way. This, however, requires an intelligent system that is capable of assessing individual competencies and learning progress by observing and interpreting the learner’s behaviour in the learning situations within the game. In ELEKTRA, a project funded by the European Commission and aiming at developing a sound psychopedagogical framework for immersive educational games, we developed a formal cognitive framework for the non-invasive assessment and interventions within complex learning situations, that is, micro adaptivity. Attuned to the assessed competencies or lack of competencies, meaningful feedback, for example hints, suggestions, reminders, critical questions, or praise, can be triggered, without destroying the gaming experience. Two questions arise with respect to feedback. First, does feedback, although designed to be non-invasive, on educational issues impair gaming experience? Second, can feedback in gaming situations facilitate the learning progress or does it increase the learner’s cognitive load, which was suggested be several researchers. In the context of the ELEKTRA project, we implemented the theoretical framework of micro adaptivity in the game demonstrator. This demonstrator is a state-of-the art 3D adventure game teaching physics in relation to national school curricula for the age group of 12 o 14 years. For evaluation purposes, log files of the gaming sessions were recorded and, in addition, questionnaires and performance tests were presented. In this work, we present results from an evaluation session. The results indicate that (micro) adaptive interventions (i.e., appropriate and meaningful interventions/feedback for an individual learner, his/her knowledge and learning progress) are superior to neutral (i.e., non-individualized but semantically correct interventions) and inappropriate interventions (i.e., non-individualized, unsuited interventions) in terms of learning and gaming measures. In addition, we analysed the relationships between learning progress and socio-emotional variables. The results indicate that adaptive feedback not only facilitates learning but also attitude and immersion.},

In this paper, we explore several issues concerning the educational effectiveness, appeal and scope of educational software games through an evaluation study of an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) that operates as a virtual reality educational game. The results of the evaluation show that educational virtual reality games can be very motivating while retaining or even improving the educational effects on students. Moreover, one important finding of the study was that the educational effectiveness of the game was particularly high for students who used to have poor performance in the domain taught prior to their learning experience with the game.},

This ubiquity has meant that games and gaming have permeated into many fields and disciplines for multiple purposes including teaching and learning. Past research has examined the use of both electronic and non-electronic games, but the field of education still lacks a comprehensive framework for exploring the role of the games for teaching and learning, the relationship of educational games to other fields, and a synthesis of best practice for current and future design, implementation, and research.

In doing so, we also hope to continue a conversation within education as well as with other fields that advance research, development and practice within a common framework. (Contains 2 figures.)},

The use of software agents has been advocated as a means to deal with the complexity of serious games. Current approaches to dynamic adjustability in games make it possible for different elements to adjust to the player. However, these approaches most use centralized control, which becomes impractical if the complexity and the number of adaptable elements increase. The serious games we are investigating are constructed using complex and independent subtasks that influence each other. In this paper, we propose a model for game adaptation that is guided by three main concerns: the trainee, the game objectives and the agents. In particular we focus on how the adaptation engine determines tasks to be adapted and how agents respond to such requests and modify their plans accordingly.},

abstract = {As video-game playing has become a ubiquitous activity in today's society, it is worth considering its potential consequences on perceptual and motor skills. It is well known that exposing an organism to an altered visual environment often results in modification of the visual system of the organism. The field of perceptual learning provides many examples of training-induced increases in performance. But perceptual learning, when it occurs, tends to be specific to the trained task; that is, generalization to new tasks is rarely found(1-10). Here we show, by contrast, that action-video-game playing is capable of altering a range of visual skills. Four experiments establish changes in different aspects of visual attention in habitual video-game players as compared with non-video-game players. In a fifth experiment, non-players trained on an action video game show marked improvement from their pre-training abilities, thereby establishing the role of playing in this effect.},

abstract = {Over the past two decades electronic games have become ingrained in our culture Children''s fixation with these games initially alarmed parents and educators, but educational researchers soon questioned whether the motivation to play could be tapped and harnessed for educational purposes. A number of educational electronic games have been developed and their success has been mixed. The great majority of these games are designed for singler players; it there is more than one player, the players are usually required to take turns playing. Althought learning within a cooperative group setting has been found to be extremely effective, designing educational games to support multiple players working together has received little atention. using a multi-player game format could provide the motivation that children need to learn and at the same time enhance both the achievement and the social interactions of the children. In order to design multiplayer educational games we must understand what motivates children to play electronic games, how to incoporate educational content into electronic games, and how to develop appropriate multi-person educational tasks. An understanding of design issues for multi-user software is also required. This essay is a literature review that addresses the issues involved in the design of educational electronic multi-player games. The relevant bodies of literature include human-computer interaction, electronic games, educational electronic games, electronic multi-player games. Two of the most relevant areas of the human-computer interaction literature are Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL). All of the bodies of literature are discussed with respect to educational electronic multiplayer games, areas where further research is required are noted, and gegneral design guidelines for educational eelectronic multi-player games are offered.},

abstract = {We are teaching a new generation of students, cradled in technologies, communication and abundance of information. The implications are that we need to focus the design of learning technologies to support social learning in context. Instead of designing technologies that ldquoteachrdquo the learner, the new social learning technologies will perform three main roles: 1) support the learner in finding the right content (right for the context, for the particular learner, for the specific purpose of the learner, right pedagogically); 2) support learners to connect with the right people (again right for the context, learner, purpose, educational goal etc.), and 3) motivate/incentivize people to learn. In the pursuit of such environments, new areas of sciences become relevant as a source of methods and techniques: social psychology, economic/game theory, multi-agent systems. The paper illustrates how social learning technologies can be designed using some existing and emerging technologies: ontologies vs. social tagging, exploratory search, collaborative vs. self-managed social recommendations, trust and reputation mechanisms, mechanism design and social visualization.},

abstract = {Educational games have the potential to provide intrinsically motivating learning experiences that immerse and engage the learner. However, the much heralded benefits of educational games seldom consider the one-size-fits-all approach to education they typically embody. The benefit provided by adaptive educational games is that of a motivating environment reinforced with a personalized learning experience. However, adapting a game to enhance its educational benefit endangers its intrinsic motivation and flow. This paper proposes a novel approach for non-invasively adapting a game to enable a personalized learning experience. This is achieved using an innovative, generic and reusable architecture, without mitigating the motivational features of gaming. An implementation of this approach in the form of the ALIGN (Adaptive Learning In Games through Noninvasion) system is detailed and the results of an authentic evaluation are discussed.},

In general, the results indicate that frequent users prefer response times of less than a second for most tasks, and that productwlty does increase as response time decreases.

However, the majority of learners—especially children or teenagers—find studying from electronic educational sources and web-based information systems less exciting than playing today’s popular computer games that, conversely, lack signs of education. In this paper, we describe an innovative concept of generating three- dimensional interactive multimedia educational games that combine the excitement and looks of popular computer games with the educational potential of e-learning, and the concept’s realization by a software system called S.M.I.L.E.: Smart Multipurpose Interactive Learning Environment. One of its key features is the automatic generation of games based on a model created by teachers without needing them to be familiar with programming or game design. Moreover, we consider various learners’ abilities and features that enable different users (including handicapped) to learn effectively by playing educational games easily created by teachers. We follow the idea that everyone needs access to quality education and are convinced that by enabling cooperative education not just among learners, but also between handicapped and able-bodied ones, we bring the humane dimension into education.},

This paper explores how the Serious Games approach can be exploited to create skills in dealing with cross-cultural issues in project management. The degree of difference this can make to real-world performance is so dramatic that managers who have experienced it are seeing it not as a way to add Incremental Improvements to TEL (Technology Enhanced Learning) but as more of a Radical Innovation – a revolutionary change. Some of the main skills required in project management are reviewed, and different models of cross-cultural analysis applied to understand how the challenges of managing projects are increased by cultural issues. Our testbed for this is an EU project TARGET that is developing the next generation TEL approach. We describe its approach and look at how the TARGET serious game can be designed to achieve enhanced cross-cultural skills in users.},

abstract = {Although player enjoyment is central to computer games, there is currently no accepted model of player enjoyment in games. There are many heuristics in the literature, based on elements such as the game interface, mechanics, gameplay, and narrative. However, there is a need to integrate these heuristics into a validated model that can be used to design, evaluate, and understand enjoyment in games. We have drawn together the various heuristics into a concise model of enjoyment in games that is structured by flow. Flow, a widely accepted model of enjoyment, includes eight elements that, we found, encompass the various heuristics from the literature. Our new model, GameFlow, consists of eight elements -- concentration, challenge, skills, control, clear goals, feedback, immersion, and social interaction. Each element includes a set of criteria for achieving enjoyment in games. An initial investigation and validation of the GameFlow model was carried out by conducting expert reviews of two real-time strategy games, one high-rating and one low-rating, using the GameFlow criteria. The result was a deeper understanding of enjoyment in real-time strategy games and the identification of the strengths and weaknesses of the GameFlow model as an evaluation tool. The GameFlow criteria were able to successfully distinguish between the high-rated and low-rated games and identify why one succeeded and the other failed. We concluded that the GameFlow model can be used in its current form to review games; further work will provide tools for designing and evaluating enjoyment in games.},

abstract = {The use of digital games in education is well documented in the literature. They have been used in preschool, K-12, the university. A specific type of digital games is board games. Adding board games to the educational process can lead to an interactive stimulating learning experience. With a board game, players often learn from one another while at the same time having fun in a competitive environment. In this paper we propose the "ELG" game, an e-learning board game that adopts the basic elements of a racing board game but fosters students creativity, problem-solving skills, and imagination as students are trying to reach the end by improving their performance in a variety of learning activities. The innovative feature of the ELG is that it offers an adaptive authoring tool that enables teachers to customize their games according to the needs, interests and motives of students. The teacher enters hierarchically categorized learning activities according to the learning goals of a course, sets the rules and assesses the learning progress easily and simply. Students participate in a discovery or exploration trying to reach the goals. After attaining them their level of activities is upgraded and they are challenged to reach the next learning goal. The dice in ELG is not randomized but controlled by the teachers in order that they can customize adaptive learning rules. The educational benefits of exploiting ELG in the learning process is that the teacher can define the levels of difficulty according to the students needs and interests, facilitate and monitor the learning rate of each student, combine a variety of evaluation techniques, and address potential learning problems in a timely manner.},

More detailed descriptions of the experiments and the theory on which this paper is based are given by Malone (1980a, 1980b). My primary goal here is to provide a set of heuristics or guidelines for designers of instructional computer games. I have articulated and organized common sense principles to spark the creativity of instructional designers (see Banet, 1979, for an unstructured list of similar principles). To demonstrate the usefulness of these principles, I have included several applications to actual or proposed instructional games. Throughout the paper I emphasize games with educational uses, but I focus on what makes the games fun, not on what makes them educational.Though I will not emphasize the point in this paper, these same ideas can be applied to other educational environments and life situations. In a sense, the categories I will describe constitute a general taxonomy of intrinsic motivation—of what makes an activity fun or rewarding for its own sake rather than for the sake of some external reward (See Lepper and Greene, 1979).I think the essential characteristics of good computer games and other intrinsically enjoyable situations can be organized into three categories: challenge, fantasy, and curiosity.},

abstract = {As video-game playing has become a ubiquitous activity in today's society, it is worth considering its potential consequences on perceptual and motor skills. It is well known that exposing an organism to an altered visual environment often results in modification of the visual system of the organism. The field of perceptual learning provides many examples of training-induced increases in performance. But perceptual learning, when it occurs, tends to be specific to the trained task; that is, generalization to new tasks is rarely found(1-10). Here we show, by contrast, that action-video-game playing is capable of altering a range of visual skills. Four experiments establish changes in different aspects of visual attention in habitual video-game players as compared with non-video-game players. In a fifth experiment, non-players trained on an action video game show marked improvement from their pre-training abilities, thereby establishing the role of playing in this effect.},

abstract = {Game-based learning is based on the idea of using the motivational and immersive potential of video games in the educational context in order to provide an enjoyable form of learning. Thereby one core question regards to the optimal conditions for enjoyable experiences in games. To address this issue one can regard to the flow theory of Csikszentmihalyi according to which the balance between the perceived challenges of a situation and the perceived skills of a person determines the quality of subjective experience. The highest quality of subjective experience will be reached when challenges and skills are equally high. This so-called flow-experience is a hedonic state that can be characterized by being immersed in the activity. Since immersion is often though as the heart of enjoyable games the balance between challenges and skills seems to be of essential importance for (educational) video games, too. However, the challenges within a video game are manifold. Thus, a more fine-grained view is proposed whereby cognitive, socio-affective, and physical challenges are differentiated. Accordingly, these different challenges address to the respective cognitive, socio-affective, and physical skills. Cognitive challenges are, e.g., solving a riddle or dealing with the learning content. To master these cognitive challenges the accordingly cognitive skills like logical thinking or problem-solving abilities are required. Socio-affective challenges regards to the (para)social interaction with game characters and the handling of highly emotional situations. To address these socio-affective challenges, socio-affective skills like social competencies or stress coping strategies are needed. Physical challenges refer to the speed and the perceptual complexity of the game. To manage these physical challenges, the respective physical skills like spatial abilities or perceptual speed are necessary. Especially (educational) adventure-games often provide cognitive, socio-affective, and physical challenges simultaneously, e.g., when solving a riddle (cognitive challenge) while interacting with a beautiful female game-character (socio-affective challenge) in a situation with exciting background music (physical challenge). Thus, the question arises how these different challenges are interrelated. Three different kinds of interrelationships, an independent, an additive, and an interactive one will be disputed and exemplarily described with respect to their impact of an optimal, adaptive game-design. The different scenarios will be discussed in the face of the already existing related research. Additionally, possible empirical approaches for a more systematic investigation of the interrelationship of cognitive, socio-affective and physical challenges will be provided.},

@phdthesis{55,
abstract = {Throughout the 1990's computer game development was dominated by the improvement of game graphics. However, graphical excellence is now the norm rather than the exception, and so other technologies are coming to the fore as developers strive to make their games stand out in an ever more crowded market. Sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) is one such technology which is now receiving a large share of game development effort as game designers attempt to create more believable computer controlled characters. Influenced by the notion of situational intelligence, this work presents the proactive persistent agent (PPA) architecture, an intelligent agent architecture that has been developed to drive the behaviours of non player support characters in character centric computer games. The key features of the architecture are that: PPA characters display believable behaviour across a diverse range of situations, through the use of role passing and fuzzy cognitive maps; PPA based characters are capable of sophisticated social behaviours based on psychological models of personality, mood and interpersonal relationships; The architecture performs in real time on machines of modest specifications; It is relatively easy for non programmers to author characters behaviours using the architecture. The PPA architecture has been used in two demonstration applications (an adventure game and a system for animating sophisticated virtual humans) which will also be presented. These applications have been used to perform a rigorous evaluation of the architecture, which will also be described. Evaluation is notoriously difficult in systems used to simulate the behaviour of virtual characters, as the key notion of believability is troublingly subjective. However, in spite of the difficulties involved, an evaluation scheme has been developed and used. The evaluation shows that the PPA architecture is ideal for the contol of non player support characters in character centric games.},

We explore the feasibility of our approach by examining how collaborative tags in online collections match these properties, and find that while tags match across the model the majority are higher level (matching broader themes and motifs rather than more specific features) which may require further investigation into their utility.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to evaluate computer game theories for educational software. We propose a framework for designing engaging educational games based on contemporary game studies which includes ludology and narratology. Ludology focuses on the study of computer games as play and game activities, while narratology revolves around the study of computer games as narratives. The proposed framework incorporates the arguments from both principles of game studies. We maintain that the enjoyment of playing games comes from two perspectives, the game play activity as well as the narrative experience. It is furthered argued that the views of both ludologists and narratologists provide an insight into how to design immersive and experiential educational software. To evaluate the theoretical framework, a survey study was conducted on a group of 100 students. The findings indicate that both theories contribute to the enjoyment factor of an educational game. Our results also suggest that the students are more motivated to learn in a game. They are aware of their learning of the subject matter, which is embedded in the game.

abstract = {IMS Learning Design (IMS-LD) is a specification to create Units of Learning (UoLs) which express a certain pedagogical model or strategy (e.g., adaptive learning with games). However, the authoring process of a UoL remains difficult due to the lack of high-level authoring tools for IMS-LD, even more so when we focus on specific topics like educational eGames. However, we can use external tools which are not specifically IMS-LD oriented. In this case, the main challenge is the integration between these external resources developed with other technologies and the personalized learning experience of an IMS-LD UoL. In this paper, we use the <e-Adventure> Project to develop conversational games that are engaged with IMS-LD UoLs to improve personalized learning. The main contribution of this setting is the integration of both parts, the IMS-LD specification and <e-Adventure>, and the communication that enables a mutual influence of the adaptive learning experience.},

abstract = {This paper reviews findings from over 70 published studies investigating various facets of learner-control in computer-based instruction (CBI). General conclusions about the relative effectiveness of learner-control versus program-control are equivocal. Across these studies, however, are strong suggestions that individual learner differences can greatly contribute to both the choices students make and to the effectiveness of those choices. Some researchers examine those differences on a global level, interacting with such broad instructional variables as learner-control versus program-control, following an aptitude-treatment interaction paradigm. Other investigators, however, look for interactions occurring on a moment-by-moment basis under micro-instructional conditions, that is the task-specific situation encountered during the course of the lesson delivery. Other paradigms are also discussed. The review extends the previous surveys of Carrier (1984), Hannafin (1984), Milheim and Martin (1981), and Steinberg (1977, 1989), paying particular attention to the role of learner individual differences in the effectiveness of learner-controlled CBI. Specifically, the impact on learner-control effectiveness of both rational-cognitive processes and emotional-motivational states of the learner are highlighted. Useful instructional prescriptions are proposed which take into account these variables. Recommendations for future research are offered.},

The underlying pedagogical approach relies on an adaptation model in order to improve group dynamics, as this has been identified as one of the key features in the success of collaborative learning scenarios. Students’ learning strategies are analyzed considering a simplified version of Vermunt’s model for learning styles. The resulting profiles provide the basis to group students in teams where each student is assigned a role according to his/her learning strategies. The result is the formation of complementary and semi-autonomous learning teams that collaborate to achieve solutions to the problems provided by the instructor. The framework is instantiated through an online multiplayer role-playing game environment, which sets a stage for the underlying collaborative problem-based learning approach. The framework has been benchmarked in different programming courses at the Complutense University of Madrid during 2007-08 and 2008-09 academic years.

abstract = {One of the major obstacles in developing quality eLearning content is the substantial development costs involved and development time required [12]. Educational providers, such as those in the university sector and corporate learning, are under increasing pressure to enhance the pedagogical quality and technical richness of their course offerings while at the same time achieving improved return on investment. One means of enhancing the educational impact of eLearning courses, while still optimizing the return on investment, is to facilitate the personalization and repurposing of learning objects across multiple related courses. However, eLearning courses typically differ strongly in ethos, learning goals and pedagogical approach whilst learners, even within the same course, may have different personal learning goals, motivations, prior knowledge and learning style preferences. This paper proposes an innovative multi-model approach to the dynamic composition and delivery of personalized learning utilizing reusable learning objects. The paper describes an adaptive metadata driven engine that composes, at runtime, tailored educational experiences across a single content base. This paper presents the theoretical models, design and implementation of the adaptive hypermedia educational service. This service is currently being successfully used for the delivery of undergraduate degree courses in Trinity College, Dublin as well as being used as part of a major EU research trial.},

abstract = {Interactive Narrative in game environments acts as the main catalyst to provide a motivating learning experience. In previous work, we have de- scribed how the use of a dual narrative generation technique could help to re- solve the conflict between allowing high player student agency and also the track of the learning process. In this paper, we define a novel architecture that assists the dual narrative generation technique to be employed effectively in an adaptive educational game environment. The architecture composes components that individually have shown effectiveness in educational games environments. These components are graph structured narrative, dynamically generated narra- tive, evolving agents and a student model. An adaptive educational game, AEINS, has been developed to investigate the synergy of the architecture components. AEINS aims to foster character education at 8-12 year old children through the use of various interactive moral dilemmas that attempt the different student's cognitive levels. AEINS was evaluated through a study involved 20 participants who interacted with AEINS on an individual basis.},

abstract = {The intrinsic motivation to play, and therefore to learn, that might be provided by digital educational games teases researchers and developers. However, existing educational games often fail in their attempt to compete with commercial games and to provide successful learning. Often some learning is added to digital games or some gameplay is added to educational applications. Successful educational games, however, require merging professional game design with sound pedagogical strategies, creating a new hybrid format. Moreover, a methodology is required that allows continuously balancing gaming and learning challenges and the learner’s abilities and knowledge in order to retain an immersive gaming experience. In this article we introduce approaches to game design and didactic design, as well as a framework for adaptive interventions in educational games.},

abstract = {In the domain of computer games, research into the interaction between player and game has centred on 'enjoyment', often drawing in particular on optimal experience research and Csikszentmihalyi's 'Flow theory'. Flow is a well-established construct for examining experience in any setting and its application to game-play is intuitive. Nevertheless, it's not immediately obvious how to translate between the flow construct and an operative description of game-play. Previous research has attempted this translation through analogy. In this article we propose a practical, integrated approach for analysis of the mechanics and aesthetics of game-play, which helps develop deeper insights into the capacity for flow within games. The relationship between player and game, characterized by learning and enjoyment, is central to our analysis. We begin by framing that relationship within Cowley's user-system-experience (USE) model, and expand this into an information systems framework, which enables a practical mapping of flow onto game-play. We believe this approach enhances our understanding of a player's interaction with a game and provides useful insights for games' researchers seeking to devise mechanisms to adapt game-play to individual players.},

A group of twenty students played four commercial games (SimIsle, Red Alert, Zork Nemesis and Duke Nukem 3D), Results suggest that students prefer 3D-adventure (Zork Nemesis) and strategy (Red Alert) games to the ether types ("shoot-em-up", simulation) with Zork Nemesis ranked as the best, Students rated game elements such as logic, memory, visualisation and problem solving as the most important game elements, Such elements are integral to adventure games and are also required during the learning process, We present a model that links pedagogical issues with game elements, The game space contains a number of components, each encapsulates specific abstract or concrete interfaces, Understanding the relationship between educational needs and game elements will allow us to develop educational games that include visualisation and problem solving skills. Such tools could provide sufficient stimulation to engage learners in knowledge discovery, while at the same time developing new skills.},

Within the last 35 years, due to numerous technology innovations, electronic games in many formats have become ubiquitous in everyday life. This ubiquity has meant that games and gaming have permeated into many fields and disciplines for multiple purposes including teaching and learning. Past research has examined the use of both electronic and non-electronic games, but the field of education still lacks a comprehensive framework for exploring the role of the games for teaching and learning, the relationship of educational games to other fields, and a synthesis of best practice for current and future design, implementation, and research. The purpose of this article is to set a framework for understanding past, current, and future research in educational gaming. In doing so, we also hope to continue a conversation within education as well as with other fields that advance research, development and practice within a common framework. (Contains 2 figures.)},

The students and teacher were observed during the lessons, interviewed after, and the completed quests were analysed to determine the level of engagement achieved. A pre- and posttest on the Science concepts covered was also administered. A seven-level taxonomy of engagement was used to provide the study with a more holistic perspective of engagement, together with the attempt to concretise the element of engagement into observable traits. Although there was a significant improvement of the posttest over the pretest, the level of engagement of the students was low (between 3 and 4). The lack of engagement might be a result of the distractions in the 3D MUVE, the students’ difficulty with language used in the QA, their lack of computer competency for QA tasks, and/or their inability to complete the quests’ section on reflections. The biggest challenges to the integration of QA into the Science curriculum were the interdependent issues of time (or lack of it) and ‘buy-in’ by the school and parents.},

The proposed model was evaluated through a business simulation game. The interviews indicated that authenticity, collaboration and learning by doing were found to be the most important characteristics of effective educational games. Results also showed that the proposed model describes well the problem- based gaming process in which the reflection phase seems to be a vital factor. The outcome of the reflection phase may be personal synthesis of knowledge, validation of hypothesis laid or a new playing strategy to be tested. However, because of the small sample size of this study, more research on the topic is recommended. Especially, ways to support reflection in games needs to be studied.},

Adaptive hypermedia (AH) systems build a model of the goals, preferences, and knowledge of each individual user, and use this model throughout the interaction with the user, in order to adapt to the needs of that user. Adaptive navigation support is a specific group of adaptive hypermedia techniques that become especially popular in educational hypermedia systems. This paper provides a brief overview of main adaptive navigation support techniques and analyzes the results of most representative empirical studies of these techniques. It demonstrates an evidence that different known techniques work most efficiently in different context. In particular, the studies summarized in the paper have provided evidence that users with different knowledge level of the subject may appreciate different adaptive navigation support technologies. The paper argues that more empirical studies are required to help the developers of adaptive hypermedia systems in selecting most relevant adaptation technologies. It also attempts to build a case for meta-adaptive hypermedia systems, ie, systems that are able to adapt the very adaptation technology to the given user and context.},

Yet, today's technologically based training systems often provide individuals with significant control over their learning (Brown, 2001). This creates a dilemma that must be addressed if technology is going to be used to create more effective training systems. The current study extended past research that has examined the effects of providing trainees with some form of advisement or guidance in addition to learner control and examined the impact of an instructional strategy, adaptive guidance, on learning and performance in a complex training environment. Overall, it was found that adaptive guidance had a substantial effect on the nature of trainees' study and practice, self-regulation, knowledge acquired, and performance.},

abstract = {The features of video games that contribute to effective learning are drawing increasing attention in the world of technology enhanced learning. To date, game based learning has focussed on the learning benefits provided by the inherent motivation, rich visualizations, and low risk of failure, provided by contemporary educational games. Although these advantages create highly engaging and immersive learning environments, there remain additional techniques that can further aid the learning process. The integration of personalisation into educational games presents unique challenges, the most important being the preservation of the gaming experience. In consideration that a well designed educational game can seamlessly blend learning and gaming content, any adaptation of the learning content will ultimately affect the gaming experience. In effect all educational adaptations must be achieved in a manner that is non-invasive to the game play. In this paper we introduce the „Language Trap‟ German language learning game that provides learners with an online casual gaming environment that also benefits from a personalised learning experience. We demonstrate how a game playable online in a browser, using simple controls, and with low production costs, can effectively deliver this personalised learning experience. Through using the ALIGN (Adaptive Learning In Games through Non-invasion) system the game delivers adaptive dialogue difficulty, performance feedback, motivational support, and meta-cognitive hints, all within a highly interactive adventure role-playing game. The results of an authentic evaluation of the Language Trap game are presented, additionally we demonstrate how the ALIGN system can effectively adapt the learning experience within the game in manner that is non-invasive to the game play. A discussion on the benefits of adaptive educational games is presented, with particular reference to the benefits provided by the ALIGN system.},

abstract = {Educational games have the potential to provide intrinsically motivating learning experiences that immerse and engage the learner. However, the much heralded benefits of educational games seldom consider the one-size-fits-all approach to education they typically embody. The benefit provided by adaptive educational games is that of a motivating environment reinforced with a personalized learning experience. However, adapting a game to enhance its educational benefit endangers its intrinsic motivation and flow. This paper proposes a novel approach for non-invasively adapting a game to enable a personalized learning experience. This is achieved using an innovative, generic and reusable architecture, without mitigating the motivational features of gaming. An implementation of this approach in the form of the ALIGN (Adaptive Learning In Games through Noninvasion) system is detailed and the results of an authentic evaluation are discussed.},

To illustrate the point, an arbitrary mental attribute called “colorfulness of the experience” is conjured up, and a set of questions administered to 74 respondents with an online questionnaire. The results suggested that colorfulness of yesterday's experiences was associated with the extent to which a person accomplished their tasks, and also associated with yesterday being a “good”, “pleasant”, but not frustrating day. The meaning lessness of this analysis illustrates that the equivalent methodology used by presence researchers, may, similarly, bring into being the idea of presence in the minds of VE participants. However, it is argued that there can be no evidence on this methodological basis that presence played any role in their actual mental activity or behavior at the time of the experience. It is concluded that presence researchers must move away from heavy reliance on questionnaires in order to make any progress in this area.},

Their efforts are distinguished from many previous writings on system development by their central and abiding reliance on direct and continuous interaction with those who are the ultimate arbiters of system adequacy; namely, those who will use the technology in their everyday lives and work. A key issue throughout is the question of who does what to whom: whose interests are at stake, who initiates action and for what reason, who defines the problem and who decides that there is one. The papers presented follow in the footsteps of a small but growing international community of scholars and practitioners of participatory systems design. Many of the original European perspectives are represented here as well as some new and distinctively American approaches. The collection is characterized by a rich anddiverse set of perspectives and experiences that, despite their differences, share a distinctive spirit and direction -- a more humane, creative, and effective relationship between those involved in technology's design and use, and between technology and the human activities that motivate the technology.},

The paper argues that this is a critical foundation for a vision of personalised lifelong learning as well as a form of augmented cognition that enables learners to supplement their own knowledge with readily accessible digital information based on documents that they have accessed or used. The paper presents work that provides foundations for this vision for a lifelong user model. First, it outlines technical issues and research into approaches for addressing them. Then it presents work on the interface between the learner and the lifelong user model because the human issues of control and privacy are so central. The final discussion and conclusions draw upon these to define a roadmap for future research in a selection of the key areas that will underpin this vision of the lifelong user model.},

abstract = {Interactive digital media, or video games, are a powerful new medium. They offer immersive experiences in which players solve problems. Players learn more than just facts--ways of seeing and understanding problems so that they "become" different kinds of people. "Serious games" coming from business strategy, advergaming, and entertainment gaming embody these features and point to a future paradigm for eLearning. Building on interviews with leading designers of serious games, this article presents case studies of three organizations building serious games, coming from different perspectives but arriving at similar conclusions. This article argues that such games challenge us to rethink the role of information, tools, and aesthetics in a digital age. (Contains 7 figures, 1 table and 5 notes.)},

Adaptive training systems are serious games whose goal it is to engender communication opportunities for players to learn about their strengths and weaknesses, receive real-time in-game performance feedback, and share diverse solutions and strategies during, between, and after game play in order to update, or adapt, player understanding. The Simulation Experience Design Method extends HCI approaches to create engaging multiplayer learning experiences by focusing on how dynamic game content, roles, scenarios, and assessment feedback contribute to emergent culture. Preliminary evaluations of an earlier instantiation of serious game-based adaptive training systems employing this design method have been positive. The contribution of the present paper lies in describing how designers create rich systems of experiences for serious games and adaptive training systems by employing HCI principles and the Simulation Experience Design Method.},

In previous work, we have de- scribed how the use of a dual narrative generation technique could help to re- solve the conflict between allowing high player student agency and also the track of the learning process. In this paper, we define a novel architecture that assists the dual narrative generation technique to be employed effectively in an adaptive educational game environment. The architecture composes components that individually have shown effectiveness in educational games environments. These components are graph structured narrative, dynamically generated narra- tive, evolving agents and a student model. An adaptive educational game, AEINS, has been developed to investigate the synergy of the architecture components. AEINS aims to foster character education at 8-12 year old children through the use of various interactive moral dilemmas that attempt the different student's cognitive levels. AEINS was evaluated through a study involved 20 participants who interacted with AEINS on an individual basis.},

@article{Cowley2008a,
abstract = {In the domain of computer games, research into the interaction between player and game has centred on 'enjoyment', often drawing in particular on optimal experience research and Csikszentmihalyi's 'Flow theory'. Flow is a well-established construct for examining experience in any setting and its application to game-play is intuitive. Nevertheless, it's not immediately obvious how to translate between the flow construct and an operative description of game-play. Previous research has attempted this translation through analogy. In this article we propose a practical, integrated approach for analysis of the mechanics and aesthetics of game-play, which helps develop deeper insights into the capacity for flow within games. The relationship between player and game, characterized by learning and enjoyment, is central to our analysis. We begin by framing that relationship within Cowley's user-system-experience (USE) model, and expand this into an information systems framework, which enables a practical mapping of flow onto game-play. We believe this approach enhances our understanding of a player's interaction with a game and provides useful insights for games' researchers seeking to devise mechanisms to adapt game-play to individual players.},

However, the effort required to build interactive dramas is quite significant. We built Thespian, an architecture that supports faster development of IPDs, open-ended interaction, encoding of pedagogical goals and quantitative metrics for evaluating those goals. Thespian uses autonomous agents to control each character and assumes that the starting point for the design process is a set of standard scripts. A “fitting” algorithm facilitates the design process by automatically adjusting the goals of the agents so that the agents perform their roles according to the scripts. This also ensures the agents will behave true to their character’s motivations even when the interactive drama deviates from the scripts. In this paper, we discuss this basic approach in detail and illustrate its application to the Tactical Language Training System.},

Thus, the aim of this research is to develop an empirically allocated model about problem-based gaming that can be utilised to design pedagogically meaningful games. The proposed model was evaluated through a business simulation game. The interviews indicated that authenticity, collaboration and learning by doing were found to be the most important characteristics of effective educational games. Results also showed that the proposed model describes well the problem- based gaming process in which the reflection phase seems to be a vital factor. The outcome of the reflection phase may be personal synthesis of knowledge, validation of hypothesis laid or a new playing strategy to be tested. However, because of the small sample size of this study, more research on the topic is recommended. Especially, ways to support reflection in games needs to be studied.},

The learning outcome need to be integrated as a goal from the start of the design process and pedagogy need to be formally incorporated into games. In this paper, we reviewed features of educational game design and history learning. Then, we discuss the application of pedagogical elements in educational game design. The result is a history game design model and level design for history multimedia interactive educational game (HMIEG). The model consists of four main elements: interaction, knowledge, engine and level.

This document-oriented approach opens new authoring possibilities in videogame development and allows a rational collaboration between the different communities that participate in the development process: game writers, artists, and programmers. We have implemented the approach in the context of the <e-Game> project, by defining a suitable markup language for the storyboards (the <e-Game> language), and by building a suitable processor for this language (the <e-Game> engine).},

Thus, the design of an educational game should be adaptive not only to the learner’s cognitive abilities, but also to the individual preferences of the player. Especially the design of the non-player character (NPC) that takes the role of a teacher by providing guidance, hints, and companionship seems of crucial importance. The presented study addresses to three design question with respect to an optimal NPC-design, namely the NPC’s personality as well as the role of naturalism and color. Based on media equation and related research several hypotheses were derived. Independent variables were the NPC’s personality (funny \& friendly vs. severe \& unfriendly), color (black \& white vs. colored design), and naturalism (naturalistic vs. comic-like appearance), resulting in a 2 x 2 x 2-design. By means of eight different NPC-versions the players had to rate and indicate which of the versions they prefer for an NPC that provides guidance and companionship in an educational adventure-game. Dependent measurements include the selection of the preferred NPC as well as an NPC-rating. The results of the used ²-tests indicate a clear preference for a colored, naturalistic NPC-design. For the NPC’s personality the pupils favor a personality that was similar to their own, indicating similarityattraction. Further results and implications for the design of educational games will be discussed.},

However, there are still open issues needing further research to generalize the use of videogames and game-like simulations in the educational system. On the one hand, how to take advantage of the videogames’ inherent adaptation behaviour in order to maximize the effectiveness of the learning experiences is still a world worth to be explored. On the other, there is still a need to develop mechanisms to track and evaluate the performance of the students when they use these learning tools. Finally, it is necessary to elaborate further game-based learning architectures that facilitate the delivery and distribution of the games to the students. In this paper we propose how to deal with all these issues taking also into account other relevant aspects such as development cost and instructor implication. This is exemplified with the HCT game, produced in cooperation with professors of the Complutense University School of Medicine at Madrid.},

However, there are still barriers between the gaming and e-learning worlds preventing their mutual interaction. In this paper we propose a middleware to bridge this gap, integrating adaptive educational videogames in e-learning environments with a special focus on the ongoing standardization efforts.},

abstract = {Interactive digital media, or video games, are a powerful new medium. They offer immersive experiences in which players solve problems. Players learn more than just facts--ways of seeing and understanding problems so that they "become" different kinds of people. "Serious games" coming from business strategy, advergaming, and entertainment gaming embody these features and point to a future paradigm for eLearning. Building on interviews with leading designers of serious games, this article presents case studies of three organizations building serious games, coming from different perspectives but arriving at similar conclusions. This article argues that such games challenge us to rethink the role of information, tools, and aesthetics in a digital age. (Contains 7 figures, 1 table and 5 notes.)},

abstract = {The notion of using games in education is as old as games themselves. In addition, the massive market opened by the digital games industry has caused great interest regarding their specific potential in education. However, this interest is sometimes thwarted by the resistance of traditional educational settings toward technology-enhanced learning and digital games. The future, on the contrary, is much more promising within the eLearning field. This field is in a process of evolution and reinvention, seeking new features and ideas to improve the learning experience. We believe that educational games are a perfect medium for these new directions in eLearning. In this article, the synergies between the new eLearning environments and educational games are explored and reviewed. 10.1177/1046878109340294},

However, this is not to suggest that HCI has little to offer the game design community. Indeed, the exact opposite appears to be true. A number of user-centred design techniques have evolved which can support each stage of the game design process, from concept through to post-production. However, there is currently no archive of appropriate techniques showing how they might be applied to videogame design. Given the differences in goals from these products to traditional software, this is clearly necessary. The purpose of this workshop is to identify those techniques appropriate to game design, and elicit practitioners' experience when applying such methodologies. The intended result is a prescriptive process which demonstrates how user-centred methodologies can best be applied to game design. },

abstract = {Modern computer games show potential not just for engaging and entertaining users, but also in promoting learning. Game designers employ a range of techniques to promote long-term user engagement and motivation. These techniques are increasingly being employed in so-called serious games, games that have non- entertainment purposes such as education or training. Although such games share the goal of AIED of promoting deep learner engagement with subject matter, the techniques employed are very different. Can AIED technologies complement and enhance serious game design techniques, or does good serious game design render AIED techniques superfluous? This paper explores these questions in the context of the Tactical Language Training System (TLTS), a program that supports rapid acquisition of foreign language and cultural skills. The TLTS combines game design principles and game development tools with learner modelling, pedagogical agents, and pedagogical dramas. Learners carry out missions in a simulated game world, interacting with non-player characters. A virtual aide assists the learners if they run into difficulties, and gives performance feedback in the context of preparatory exercises. Artificial intelligence plays a key role in controlling the behaviour of the non-player characters in the game; intelligent tutoring provides supplementary scaffolding.},

Adaptive hypermedia (AH) systems build a model of the goals, preferences, and knowledge of each individual user, and use this model throughout the interaction with the user, in order to adapt to the needs of that user. Adaptive navigation support is a specific group of adaptive hypermedia techniques that become especially popular in educational hypermedia systems. This paper provides a brief overview of main adaptive navigation support techniques and analyzes the results of most representative empirical studies of these techniques. It demonstrates an evidence that different known techniques work most efficiently in different context. In particular, the studies summarized in the paper have provided evidence that users with different knowledge level of the subject may appreciate different adaptive navigation support technologies. The paper argues that more empirical studies are required to help the developers of adaptive hypermedia systems in selecting most relevant adaptation technologies. It also attempts to build a case for meta-adaptive hypermedia systems, ie, systems that are able to adapt the very adaptation technology to the given user and context.},

abstract = {Game-based learning is based on the idea of using the motivational and immersive potential of video games in the educational context in order to provide an enjoyable form of learning. Thereby one core question regards to the optimal conditions for enjoyable experiences in games. To address this issue one can regard to the flow theory of Csikszentmihalyi according to which the balance between the perceived challenges of a situation and the perceived skills of a person determines the quality of subjective experience. The highest quality of subjective experience will be reached when challenges and skills are equally high. This so-called flow-experience is a hedonic state that can be characterized by being immersed in the activity. Since immersion is often though as the heart of enjoyable games the balance between challenges and skills seems to be of essential importance for (educational) video games, too. However, the challenges within a video game are manifold. Thus, a more fine-grained view is proposed whereby cognitive, socio-affective, and physical challenges are differentiated. Accordingly, these different challenges address to the respective cognitive, socio-affective, and physical skills. Cognitive challenges are, e.g., solving a riddle or dealing with the learning content. To master these cognitive challenges the accordingly cognitive skills like logical thinking or problem-solving abilities are required. Socio-affective challenges regards to the (para)social interaction with game characters and the handling of highly emotional situations. To address these socio-affective challenges, socio-affective skills like social competencies or stress coping strategies are needed. Physical challenges refer to the speed and the perceptual complexity of the game. To manage these physical challenges, the respective physical skills like spatial abilities or perceptual speed are necessary. Especially (educational) adventure-games often provide cognitive, socio-affective, and physical challenges simultaneously, e.g., when solving a riddle (cognitive challenge) while interacting with a beautiful female game-character (socio-affective challenge) in a situation with exciting background music (physical challenge). Thus, the question arises how these different challenges are interrelated. Three different kinds of interrelationships, an independent, an additive, and an interactive one will be disputed and exemplarily described with respect to their impact of an optimal, adaptive game-design. The different scenarios will be discussed in the face of the already existing related research. Additionally, possible empirical approaches for a more systematic investigation of the interrelationship of cognitive, socio-affective and physical challenges will be provided.},

abstract = {Most current serious games suffer from system inflexibility, which is responsible for stereotyped training scenarios and predictable game-play. My goal is to support adaptivity in serious games by allowing virtual scenarios to dynamically adjust to what and how players should learn. Adaptivity should give players more effective gaming and learning experiences, if it is guided by their Instructors' knowledge about both players and learning goals. I expect to enable Instructors to create adaptive scenarios through specification of: what players have to learn, how they should learn it and, afterwards, what went missing. This work focuses on embedding this sort of knowledge into objects of the virtual scenario, through new semantic modeling methods. Meaningful information on what to learn will be solved into generating pre-game scenarios. How to learn knowledge will be used to create in-game adaptable objects and events. Assessments on what went missing will be solved to re-generate post-game (try again) scenarios.},

abstract = {The use of digital games in education is well documented in the literature. They have been used in preschool, K-12, the university. A specific type of digital games is board games. Adding board games to the educational process can lead to an interactive stimulating learning experience. With a board game, players often learn from one another while at the same time having fun in a competitive environment. In this paper we propose the "ELG" game, an e-learning board game that adopts the basic elements of a racing board game but fosters students creativity, problem-solving skills, and imagination as students are trying to reach the end by improving their performance in a variety of learning activities. The innovative feature of the ELG is that it offers an adaptive authoring tool that enables teachers to customize their games according to the needs, interests and motives of students. The teacher enters hierarchically categorized learning activities according to the learning goals of a course, sets the rules and assesses the learning progress easily and simply. Students participate in a discovery or exploration trying to reach the goals. After attaining them their level of activities is upgraded and they are challenged to reach the next learning goal. The dice in ELG is not randomized but controlled by the teachers in order that they can customize adaptive learning rules. The educational benefits of exploiting ELG in the learning process is that the teacher can define the levels of difficulty according to the students needs and interests, facilitate and monitor the learning rate of each student, combine a variety of evaluation techniques, and address potential learning problems in a timely manner.},

abstract = {According to Roger Caillois, play is "an occasion of pure waste: waste of time, energy, ingenuity, skill, and often of money." In spite of this--or because of it--play constitutes an essential element of human social and
spiritual development.

In this classic study, Caillois defines play as a free and voluntary activity that occurs in a pure space, isolated and protected from the rest of life. Play is uncertain, since the outcome may not be foreseen, and it is governed
by rules that provide a level playing field for all participants. In its most basic form, play consists of finding a response to the opponent's action--or
to the play situation--that is free within the limits set by the rules.

Caillois qualifies types of games-- according to whether competition, chance,

abstract = {Modern computer games show potential not just for engaging and entertaining users, but also in promoting learning. Game designers employ a range of techniques to promote long-term user engagement and motivation. These techniques are increasingly being employed in so-called serious games, games that have non- entertainment purposes such as education or training. Although such games share the goal of AIED of promoting deep learner engagement with subject matter, the techniques employed are very different. Can AIED technologies complement and enhance serious game design techniques, or does good serious game design render AIED techniques superfluous? This paper explores these questions in the context of the Tactical Language Training System (TLTS), a program that supports rapid acquisition of foreign language and cultural skills. The TLTS combines game design principles and game development tools with learner modelling, pedagogical agents, and pedagogical dramas. Learners carry out missions in a simulated game world, interacting with non-player characters. A virtual aide assists the learners if they run into difficulties, and gives performance feedback in the context of preparatory exercises. Artificial intelligence plays a key role in controlling the behaviour of the non-player characters in the game; intelligent tutoring provides supplementary scaffolding.},

abstract = {The idea of utilizing the rich potential of today's computer games for educational purposes excites educators, scientists and technicians. Despite the significant hype over digital game-based learning, the genre is currently at an early stage. One of the most significant challenges for research and development in this area is establishing intelligent mechanisms to support and guide the learner, and to realize a subtle balance between learning and gaming, and between challenge and ability on an individual basis. In contrast to traditional approaches of adaptive and intelligent tutoring, the key advantage of games is their immersive and motivational potential. Because of this, the psycho-pedagogical and didactic measures must not compromise gaming experience, immersion and flow. In the present paper, we introduce the concept of micro-adaptivity, an approach that enables an educational game to intelligently monitor and interpret the learner's behaviour in the game's virtual world in a non-invasive manner. On this basis, micro-adaptivity enables interventions, support, guidance or feedback in a meaningful, personalized way that is embedded in the game's flow. The presented approach was developed in the context of the European Enhanced Learning Experience and Knowledge TRAnsfer project. This project also realized a prototype game, demonstrating the capabilities, strengths and weaknesses of micro-adaptivity.},

In this paper, we explore several issues concerning the educational effectiveness, appeal and scope of educational software games through an evaluation study of an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) that operates as a virtual reality educational game. The results of the evaluation show that educational virtual reality games can be very motivating while retaining or even improving the educational effects on students. Moreover, one important finding of the study was that the educational effectiveness of the game was particularly high for students who used to have poor performance in the domain taught prior to their learning experience with the game.},

This approach is oriented to the production and maintenance of adventure videogames using the game’s storyboard as the key development element. The videogame storyboard is marked up with a suitable domain-specific descriptive markup language, from which the different art assets that are needed are referred to, and then the final executable videogame itself is automatically produced by processing the marked storyboard with a suitable processor for such a language. This document-oriented approach opens new authoring possibilities in videogame development and allows a rational collaboration between the different communities that participate in the development process: game writers, artists, and programmers. We have implemented the approach in the context of the <e-Game> project, by defining a suitable markup language for the storyboards (the <e-Game> language), and by building a suitable processor for this language (the <e-Game> engine).},

General conclusions about the relative effectiveness of learner-control versus program-control are equivocal. Across these studies, however, are strong suggestions that individual learner differences can greatly contribute to both the choices students make and to the effectiveness of those choices. Some researchers examine those differences on a global level, interacting with such broad instructional variables as learner-control versus program-control, following an aptitude-treatment interaction paradigm. Other investigators, however, look for interactions occurring on a moment-by-moment basis under micro-instructional conditions, that is the task-specific situation encountered during the course of the lesson delivery. Other paradigms are also discussed. The review extends the previous surveys of Carrier (1984), Hannafin (1984), Milheim and Martin (1981), and Steinberg (1977, 1989), paying particular attention to the role of learner individual differences in the effectiveness of learner-controlled CBI. Specifically, the impact on learner-control effectiveness of both rational-cognitive processes and emotional-motivational states of the learner are highlighted. Useful instructional prescriptions are proposed which take into account these variables. Recommendations for future research are offered.},

spiritual development.

In this classic study, Caillois defines play as a free and voluntary activity that occurs in a pure space, isolated and protected from the rest of life. Play is uncertain, since the outcome may not be foreseen, and it is governed
by rules that provide a level playing field for all participants. In its most basic form, play consists of finding a response to the opponent's action--or
to the play situation--that is free within the limits set by the rules.

Caillois qualifies types of games-- according to whether competition, chance,
simulation, or vertigo (being physically out of control) is dominant--and ways
of playing, ranging from the unrestricted improvisation characteristic of
children's play to the disciplined pursuit of solutions to gratuitously
difficult puzzles. Caillois also examines the means by which games become part

characteristic customs and institutions.

Thus, the design of an educational game should be adaptive not only to the learner’s cognitive abilities, but also to the individual preferences of the player. Especially the design of the non-player character (NPC) that takes the role of a teacher by providing guidance, hints, and companionship seems of crucial importance. The presented study addresses to three design question with respect to an optimal NPC-design, namely the NPC’s personality as well as the role of naturalism and color. Based on media equation and related research several hypotheses were derived. Independent variables were the NPC’s personality (funny \& friendly vs. severe \& unfriendly), color (black \& white vs. colored design), and naturalism (naturalistic vs. comic-like appearance), resulting in a 2 x 2 x 2-design. By means of eight different NPC-versions the players had to rate and indicate which of the versions they prefer for an NPC that provides guidance and companionship in an educational adventure-game. Dependent measurements include the selection of the preferred NPC as well as an NPC-rating. The results of the used ²-tests indicate a clear preference for a colored, naturalistic NPC-design. For the NPC’s personality the pupils favor a personality that was similar to their own, indicating similarityattraction. Further results and implications for the design of educational games will be discussed.},

Early data from the pilot suggests that not only do teachers and students enjoy using Skills Arena, students have exceeded our expectations by doing three times more math problems in 19 days than they would have using traditional worksheets. Based on this encouraging qualitative study, future work that focuses on quantitative benefits should likely uncover additional positive results.},

@article{Kickmeier-Rust2010a,
abstract = {The idea of utilizing the rich potential of today's computer games for educational purposes excites educators, scientists and technicians. Despite the significant hype over digital game-based learning, the genre is currently at an early stage. One of the most significant challenges for research and development in this area is establishing intelligent mechanisms to support and guide the learner, and to realize a subtle balance between learning and gaming, and between challenge and ability on an individual basis. In contrast to traditional approaches of adaptive and intelligent tutoring, the key advantage of games is their immersive and motivational potential. Because of this, the psycho-pedagogical and didactic measures must not compromise gaming experience, immersion and flow. In the present paper, we introduce the concept of micro-adaptivity, an approach that enables an educational game to intelligently monitor and interpret the learner's behaviour in the game's virtual world in a non-invasive manner. On this basis, micro-adaptivity enables interventions, support, guidance or feedback in a meaningful, personalized way that is embedded in the game's flow. The presented approach was developed in the context of the European Enhanced Learning Experience and Knowledge TRAnsfer project. This project also realized a prototype game, demonstrating the capabilities, strengths and weaknesses of micro-adaptivity.},

@inproceedings{Kickmeier-Rust2008b,
abstract = {A crucial factor for successful digital educational games, particularly for older children and adolescents, is an appropriate balance; balance between learning and gaming and balance between challenge and ability. These factors are important to maintain fun, immersion, flow experience, and motivation – the motivation to play and therefore to learn. Moreover, it is important to realize a gaming experience that can compete with that of commercial, non-educational games. A special challenge in this context arises from the need for pedagogical support during learning - and therefore during gaming. At many staves of the learning ladder, from a psych-pedagogical perspective, support and feedback is necessary in order to ensure successful, effective, and complacent learning. Considering the importance of not destroying immersion with the game, the assessment of the learning progress and psycho-pedagogical feedback must occur in a non-invasive way. This, however, requires an intelligent system that is capable of assessing individual competencies and learning progress by observing and interpreting the learner’s behaviour in the learning situations within the game. In ELEKTRA, a project funded by the European Commission and aiming at developing a sound psychopedagogical framework for immersive educational games, we developed a formal cognitive framework for the non-invasive assessment and interventions within complex learning situations, that is, micro adaptivity. Attuned to the assessed competencies or lack of competencies, meaningful feedback, for example hints, suggestions, reminders, critical questions, or praise, can be triggered, without destroying the gaming experience. Two questions arise with respect to feedback. First, does feedback, although designed to be non-invasive, on educational issues impair gaming experience? Second, can feedback in gaming situations facilitate the learning progress or does it increase the learner’s cognitive load, which was suggested be several researchers. In the context of the ELEKTRA project, we implemented the theoretical framework of micro adaptivity in the game demonstrator. This demonstrator is a state-of-the art 3D adventure game teaching physics in relation to national school curricula for the age group of 12 o 14 years. For evaluation purposes, log files of the gaming sessions were recorded and, in addition, questionnaires and performance tests were presented. In this work, we present results from an evaluation session. The results indicate that (micro) adaptive interventions (i.e., appropriate and meaningful interventions/feedback for an individual learner, his/her knowledge and learning progress) are superior to neutral (i.e., non-individualized but semantically correct interventions) and inappropriate interventions (i.e., non-individualized, unsuited interventions) in terms of learning and gaming measures. In addition, we analysed the relationships between learning progress and socio-emotional variables. The results indicate that adaptive feedback not only facilitates learning but also attitude and immersion.},

Half of the students in each group were also offered choices concerning instructionally incidental aspects of the learning contexts; the remainder were not.

But are these games really as useful as people suggest, or are they simply too shallow to convey sufficient pedagogical meaning? And how do we assess how well these games measure up as educational resources? This paper first generates a “conclusive” list of educational requirements from a structured review of other researchers proposed requirements. It then presents details of the three most interesting educational mini-games taken from an investigation of around 30. Whilst some games were able to offer immersive, curiosity-provoking experiences full of relevant information, many of the games were shallow, formulaic, and lacking in information. Finally, conclusions and future work are proposed, including the packaging of mini-games into compendia to add depth, the use of mini-games in blended learning scenarios, and mechanisms to harvest the relatively simple player interactions to assist learner assessment. These findings aim to help educators make a more informed decision as to whether these games are right for their educational aims.},

The underlying pedagogical approach relies on an adaptation model in order to improve group dynamics, as this has been identified as one of the key features in the success of collaborative learning scenarios. Students’ learning strategies are analyzed considering a simplified version of Vermunt’s model for learning styles. The resulting profiles provide the basis to group students in teams where each student is assigned a role according to his/her learning strategies. The result is the formation of complementary and semi-autonomous learning teams that collaborate to achieve solutions to the problems provided by the instructor. The framework is instantiated through an online multiplayer role-playing game environment, which sets a stage for the underlying collaborative problem-based learning approach. The framework has been benchmarked in different programming courses at the Complutense University of Madrid during 2007-08 and 2008-09 academic years.

A pre-post design was employed. The participants were 71 primary school children (10-11 years old) from three classes. In School 1, a class of 21 children used a games console for 20 minutes each day, running a 'brain training' game. Two comparison groups were used. In School 2, 31 children used 'Brain Gym' techniques in their class over the treatment period. In school three, a class of 19 children acted as no-treatment controls. The treatment period was 10 weeks. Significant pre-post gains were found in the games console group for both accuracy and speed of calculations, while results for the two comparison groups were mixed. The games console group showed significant gains in global self-esteem, but not in other aspects of self-concept. The comparison groups showed no significant gains in any area of self-perceptions. There is a need now for upscaling to investigate generalisability.},

abstract = {Games for learning cannot take the same design approach as games when targeting audiences. While players of entertainment games have the luxury of choosing games that suit them, students using digital games for learning typically have a single game for them to learn from, regardless of whether or not it fits their playing style or learning needs. We contend that this problem can be addressed by creating games that identify the kind of player-learner using the game and adapts itself to best fit that individual. These adaptive games can specialize themselves according to a student's learning needs, gameplay preferences, and learning style. We present a prototype mini-game, called S.C.R.U.B., which employs this method for teaching microbiology concepts.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to evaluate computer game theories for educational software. We propose a framework for designing engaging educational games based on contemporary game studies which includes ludology and narratology. Ludology focuses on the study of computer games as play and game activities, while narratology revolves around the study of computer games as narratives. The proposed framework incorporates the arguments from both principles of game studies. We maintain that the enjoyment of playing games comes from two perspectives, the game play activity as well as the narrative experience. It is furthered argued that the views of both ludologists and narratologists provide an insight into how to design immersive and experiential educational software. To evaluate the theoretical framework, a survey study was conducted on a group of 100 students. The findings indicate that both theories contribute to the enjoyment factor of an educational game. Our results also suggest that the students are more motivated to learn in a game. They are aware of their learning of the subject matter, which is embedded in the game.

The aim of this exploratory study was to investigate the effects of a commercial off-the-shelf computer game on children's mental computation skills and on aspects of self-perceptions. A pre-post design was employed. The participants were 71 primary school children (10-11 years old) from three classes. In School 1, a class of 21 children used a games console for 20 minutes each day, running a 'brain training' game. Two comparison groups were used. In School 2, 31 children used 'Brain Gym' techniques in their class over the treatment period. In school three, a class of 19 children acted as no-treatment controls. The treatment period was 10 weeks. Significant pre-post gains were found in the games console group for both accuracy and speed of calculations, while results for the two comparison groups were mixed. The games console group showed significant gains in global self-esteem, but not in other aspects of self-concept. The comparison groups showed no significant gains in any area of self-perceptions. There is a need now for upscaling to investigate generalisability.},

But are these games really as useful as people suggest, or are they simply too shallow to convey sufficient pedagogical meaning? And how do we assess how well these games measure up as educational resources? This paper first generates a “conclusive” list of educational requirements from a structured review of other researchers proposed requirements. It then presents details of the three most interesting educational mini-games taken from an investigation of around 30. Whilst some games were able to offer immersive, curiosity-provoking experiences full of relevant information, many of the games were shallow, formulaic, and lacking in information. Finally, conclusions and future work are proposed, including the packaging of mini-games into compendia to add depth, the use of mini-games in blended learning scenarios, and mechanisms to harvest the relatively simple player interactions to assist learner assessment. These findings aim to help educators make a more informed decision as to whether these games are right for their educational aims.},

abstract = {The focus of this paper is on the use of e-technologies to enable higher education to better assess aspects of learning that have proved difficult to assess using more conventional means. Higher education describes the knowledge and abilities it intends its graduates to have acquired before graduation, and it has a wide range of approaches to assess these. Higher education also seeks affective outcomes in the form of values, attitudes, behaviours and related attributes or dispositions, and these have consistently proved more difficult to assess by examination or assignment. After graduation, however, graduates are often assessed within the professions via portfolios, interview and peer or expert review. Assessment may focus on teamwork and networking skills, productivity, creativity and values fit to the profession. How can e-technologies help with these forms of assessment? This paper reviews some of the e-based approaches and explorations that have supported or could support assessment of affective attributes. At each stage, the paper seeks to establish the common elements of assessment in the different regimes and how e-assessment contributes, or may contribute in the future. The paper concludes that many of the strengths of e-assessment lend themselves to an evaluation paradigm rather than to conventional assessment for intended learning outcomes.},

The paper argues that this is a critical foundation for a vision of personalised lifelong learning as well as a form of augmented cognition that enables learners to supplement their own knowledge with readily accessible digital information based on documents that they have accessed or used. The paper presents work that provides foundations for this vision for a lifelong user model. First, it outlines technical issues and research into approaches for addressing them. Then it presents work on the interface between the learner and the lifelong user model because the human issues of control and privacy are so central. The final discussion and conclusions draw upon these to define a roadmap for future research in a selection of the key areas that will underpin this vision of the lifelong user model.},

To achieve this, the director tracks the trainee’s demonstration of knowledge and skills during the training experience. Using that information, the director plays a role similar to that of a schoolhouse trainer, customizing training scenarios to meet individual trainee needs. The director can react to trainee actions within a scenario, dynamically adapting the environment to the learning needs of trainee as well as the dramatic needs of the scene.

On the one hand, how to take advantage of the videogames’ inherent adaptation behaviour in order to maximize the effectiveness of the learning experiences is still a world worth to be explored. On the other, there is still a need to develop mechanisms to track and evaluate the performance of the students when they use these learning tools. Finally, it is necessary to elaborate further game-based learning architectures that facilitate the delivery and distribution of the games to the students. In this paper we propose how to deal with all these issues taking also into account other relevant aspects such as development cost and instructor implication.

abstract = {This paper describes how a personalised educational game architecture has been used in conjunction with Web services to provide remote access to the system. The educational game is a virtual reality adventure game that performs affective user modelling by measuring emotional characteristics of users. Virtual reality (VR) games are so popular among children and adolescents that can be used for the purposes of educational software to render it more attractive and motivating. The benefits of such an application can be maximised if it is available over the Web. Software applications that operate over the Web are targeted to a wide range of users. Hence they need a high degree of adaptivity and dynamic individualisation to each user that interacts with the application. This should include the students’ emotional state that affects their learning. However, the environment of a Web-based VR-game that performs user modelling is so demanding that the technology of Web services is necessary for its effective operation and interoperability. Moreover, reusability may be achieved for the user modelling component.},

abstract = {Virtual environments for training, especially collaborative ones, require adaptability in order to be used in various situations. In this paper, we classify the needs for adaptation into two levels. The first one concerns the application setting. The second one is a dynamic adaptation, at runtime. The models proposed in this paper fulfill these two levels of requirements. Virtual world, virtual humans’ behavior, sce- nario and application configuration can be adapted to a specific training situation. Moreover, an action selection mechanism enables actors to dy- namically adapt their action scheduling to a situation. This situation is defined by a current context, past actions and a goal to achieve, namely a scenario. Finally we validate our models by presenting an illustrative scenario: the collaborative assembly of a piece of furniture.},

abstract = {Throughout the 1990's computer game development was dominated by the improvement of game graphics. However, graphical excellence is now the norm rather than the exception, and so other technologies are coming to the fore as developers strive to make their games stand out in an ever more crowded market. Sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) is one such technology which is now receiving a large share of game development effort as game designers attempt to create more believable computer controlled characters. Influenced by the notion of situational intelligence, this work presents the proactive persistent agent (PPA) architecture, an intelligent agent architecture that has been developed to drive the behaviours of non player support characters in character centric computer games. The key features of the architecture are that: PPA characters display believable behaviour across a diverse range of situations, through the use of role passing and fuzzy cognitive maps; PPA based characters are capable of sophisticated social behaviours based on psychological models of personality, mood and interpersonal relationships; The architecture performs in real time on machines of modest specifications; It is relatively easy for non programmers to author characters behaviours using the architecture. The PPA architecture has been used in two demonstration applications (an adventure game and a system for animating sophisticated virtual humans) which will also be presented. These applications have been used to perform a rigorous evaluation of the architecture, which will also be described. Evaluation is notoriously difficult in systems used to simulate the behaviour of virtual characters, as the key notion of believability is troublingly subjective. However, in spite of the difficulties involved, an evaluation scheme has been developed and used. The evaluation shows that the PPA architecture is ideal for the contol of non player support characters in character centric games.},

However, the majority of learners—especially children or teenagers—find studying from electronic educational sources and web-based information systems less exciting than playing today’s popular computer games that, conversely, lack signs of education. In this paper, we describe an innovative concept of generating three- dimensional interactive multimedia educational games that combine the excitement and looks of popular computer games with the educational potential of e-learning, and the concept’s realization by a software system called S.M.I.L.E.: Smart Multipurpose Interactive Learning Environment. One of its key features is the automatic generation of games based on a model created by teachers without needing them to be familiar with programming or game design. Moreover, we consider various learners’ abilities and features that enable different users (including handicapped) to learn effectively by playing educational games easily created by teachers. We follow the idea that everyone needs access to quality education and are convinced that by enabling cooperative education not just among learners, but also between handicapped and able-bodied ones, we bring the humane dimension into education.},

In addition, the massive market opened by the digital games industry has caused great interest regarding their specific potential in education.

The future, on the contrary, is much more promising within the eLearning field. This field is in a process of evolution and reinvention, seeking new features and ideas to improve the learning experience.

In addition, temporal properties to be verified are described using an extensible assertion language, which can be tailored to each specific application scenario. When the framework determines that some of these properties do not hold, it generates an animation of a counterexample. This approach facilitates the collaboration of multidisciplinary teams of experts during the verification of the integrity of the game scripts, exchanging hours of manual verification for semi-automatic verification processes that also facilitate the diagnosis of the conditions that may potentially break the games.},

The Simulation Experience Design Method extends HCI approaches to create engaging multiplayer learning experiences by focusing on how dynamic game content, roles, scenarios, and assessment feedback contribute to emergent culture. Preliminary evaluations of an earlier instantiation of serious game-based adaptive training systems employing this design method have been positive.

abstract = {IMS Learning Design (IMS-LD) is a specification to create Units of Learning (UoLs) which express a certain pedagogical model or strategy (e.g., adaptive learning with games). However, the authoring process of a UoL remains difficult due to the lack of high-level authoring tools for IMS-LD, even more so when we focus on specific topics like educational eGames. However, we can use external tools which are not specifically IMS-LD oriented. In this case, the main challenge is the integration between these external resources developed with other technologies and the personalized learning experience of an IMS-LD UoL. In this paper, we use the <e-Adventure> Project to develop conversational games that are engaged with IMS-LD UoLs to improve personalized learning. The main contribution of this setting is the integration of both parts, the IMS-LD specification and <e-Adventure>, and the communication that enables a mutual influence of the adaptive learning experience.},

A total of 50 articles and 55 educational games met specified selection criteria. The pedagogical foundations of the games were further investigated by contacting the authors of the games. Twenty-two games were based on established learning theories or instructional strategies and two games included basic instructional events that were not associated with any particular theory or strategy. No information regarding the pedagogical foundations of the 31 games was found or received. Analysis of the games and supporting literature revealed several patterns of practice that may be used to guide future research and development of educational games. (Contains 1 table.)},

We illustrate the architecture of an agent mediated-collaborative system that can serve the role of a tutor within a virtual group. In the virtual group the software agent should play besides the tutoring role also the group management role. The group manager has the responsibility to control the coherence of the actual group in regard to the actual group structure definition. This research will highlight also the incorporation of social-filter algorithms to mental models of software animated agents. Those algorithms may qualify an agent's expression of its emotional state by the social context, thereby enhancing the agent's believability not only as a tutor but also as a conversational partner or virtual teammate.},

The main hypothesis received support: for a same duration, the video game task was estimated as shorter than the reading task. Moreover, participants with a game-inclined profile showed a stronger underestimation of time while playing. Finally, the short durations were overestimated and the long duration underestimated. The main findings are accounted for by an attention-based explanation.},

To illustrate the point, an arbitrary mental attribute called “colorfulness of the experience” is conjured up, and a set of questions administered to 74 respondents with an online questionnaire. The results suggested that colorfulness of yesterday's experiences was associated with the extent to which a person accomplished their tasks, and also associated with yesterday being a “good”, “pleasant”, but not frustrating day. The meaning lessness of this analysis illustrates that the equivalent methodology used by presence researchers, may, similarly, bring into being the idea of presence in the minds of VE participants. However, it is argued that there can be no evidence on this methodological basis that presence played any role in their actual mental activity or behavior at the time of the experience. It is concluded that presence researchers must move away from heavy reliance on questionnaires in order to make any progress in this area.},

abstract = {The increasing amount of new technologies (including multimedia, internet and virtual reality) allows us to use new approaches in design and implementation of applications of various kinds. Specific requirements emerge in the case of users with specific needs. One such example might be the use of 3D information in the web environment (and navigation in such an environment) by visually impaired users. Our solution provides semantic and functional description of the scene objects and inter-object relations in addition to "standard" geometric scene description. This approach permits the user to query for various information in the virtual environment (e.g. searching for a path to a specific object, searching for an object with specific properties and particularly filtering scene information). The system should allow the visually impaired user to virtually walk through the scene and query for information about the objects in a scene. In such a way they are able to obtain information that has been available to users without visual impairments. The user interface itself provides the feedback in accordance with the user's group's specific requirements - the feedback is implemented as a human readable text that can be simply accessed using one of the common accessibility tools (screen reader, Braille display etc.). The embedded module capable of providing speech output has also been implemented.},

@article{Zimmerman2000,
abstract = {During the past two decades, self-efficacy has emerged as a highly effective predictor of students' motivation and learning. As a performance-based measure of perceived capability, self-efficacy differs conceptually and psychometrically from related motivational constructs, such as outcome expectations, self-concept, or locus of control. Researchers have succeeded in verifying its discriminant validity as well as convergent validity in predicting common motivational outcomes, such as students' activity choices, effort, persistence, and emotional reactions. Self-efficacy beliefs have been found to be sensitive to subtle changes in students' performance context, to interact with self-regulated learning processes, and to mediate students' academic achievement.

@article{Othman2008,
abstract = {It is estimated that our children, before they leave college, will spend 10000 hours playing video games. Their popularity is due to the immersive environments of 3-D and the element of challenging play and the freedom to create and act in collaborative environment that provide instantaneous feedback. The potential of these games for education is the subject of much debate amongst both educationalists and technologists. One of the key questions is whether play and act on-line can lead to the sort of purposeful and serious learning expected in post secondary education. This project will explore how video games can be used to support learning using the rich environments that virtual worlds offer and opportunities such as creating dynamic avatars that change with the learners actions. Environments like 2nd Life will be used in conjunction with the innovative PBL One-Day, One-Problem pedagogy at Republic Polytechnic (RP) to explore the impacts on learning when elements of EVGs are introduced to a segment of the first year students. This paper will seek to provide a brief description of the project that has just started and that will continue till 2010.},

@article{ElSaadawi2010,
abstract = {Previous studies in our laboratory have shown the benefits of immediate feedback on cognitive performance for pathology residents using an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) in pathology. In this study, we examined the effect of immediate feedback on metacognitive performance, and investigated whether other metacognitive scaffolds will support metacognitive gains when immediate feedback is faded. Twenty-three participants were randomized into intervention and control groups. For both groups, periods working with the ITS under varying conditions were alternated with independent computer-based assessments. On day 1, a within-subjects design was used to evaluate the effect of immediate feedback on cognitive and metacognitive performance. On day 2, a between-subjects design was used to compare the use of other metacognitive scaffolds (intervention group) against no metacognitive scaffolds (control group) on cognitive and metacognitive performance, as immediate feedback was faded. Measurements included learning gains (a measure of cognitive performance), as well as several measures of metacognitive performance, including Goodman-Kruskal gamma correlation (G), bias, and discrimination. For the intervention group, we also computed metacognitive measures during tutoring sessions. Results showed that immediate feedback in an intelligent tutoring system had a statistically significant positive effect on learning gains, G and discrimination. Removal of immediate feedback was associated with decreasing metacognitive performance, and this decline was not prevented when students used a version of the tutoring system that provided other metacognitive scaffolds. Results obtained directly from the ITS suggest that other metacognitive scaffolds do have a positive effect on G and discrimination, as immediate feedback is faded. We conclude that immediate feedback had a positive effect on both metacognitive and cognitive gains in a medical tutoring system. Other metacognitive scaffolds were not sufficient to replace immediate feedback in this study. However, results obtained directly from the tutoring system are not consistent with results obtained from assessments. In order to facilitate transfer to real-world tasks, further research will be needed to determine the optimum methods for supporting metacognition as immediate feedback is faded.},

@incollection{Eccles1998,
abstract = {(from the chapter) The Latin root of motivation means to move and fundamentally, motivational psychologists study what moves people to act and why people think and do what they do (Weiner, 1992). In keeping with this broad view of motivation, we focus on individuals' choices about which tasks to do, the persistence with which they pursue these tasks, the intensity of their engagement in these tasks, and their thoughts about their performance and their goals (see also Eccles-Parsons et al., 1983; Wigfield \& Eccles, 1992). The work reviewed here addresses the following types of questions: Why do people have different goals? Why do some people invest time and energy in developing their academic skills, while others, with similar levels of intellectual ability, focus on other skills such as sports, or no particular skills at all? Why do some continue to persist even when they are struggling, while others quit at the first sign of difficulty? In addition, since most of the relevant developmental work has focused on achievement motivationthe motive related to performance on tasks involving standards of excellencewe focus on this particular aspect of motivation. We begin with a brief historical review of the early developmentally focused theories and empirical work and then discuss more extensively the current theoretical perspectives and empirical work on developmental changes in, socialization of, and contextual influences on motivation.

Ac- cordingly, research guided by self-determination theo\~{} has focused on the social-contextual conditions that facil- itate versus forestall the natural processes of self-motiva- tion and healthy psychological development. Specifically, factors have been examined that enhance versus undermine intrinsic motivation, self-regulation, and well-being. The findings have led to the postulate of three innate psycho- logical needs-competence, autonomy, and relatedness- which when satisfied yield enhanced self-motivation and mental health and when thwarted lead to diminished mo- tivation and well-being. Also considered is the significance of these psychological needs and processes within domains such as health care, education, work, sport, religion, and psychotherapy.},

@incollection{Gee1997,
abstract = {(from the chapter) This chapter is ultimately about reading. I first look at how children acquire the concepts associated with words. This suggests a view of mind, meaning and learning that stresses the situation and sociocultural nature of all of them and contains important implications for educational theory and practice. Then I turn to the nature of reading, both in terms of textual types (genres) and content, arguing that the model of concept acquisition sketched earlier is also a model of reading. Finally, I briefly discuss the implications of this model in the context of debates over the death of the literary canon and proposals for critical or resistant reading. I do this because I want to suggest how talk about the mind, far from precluding political discussion, invites it., The approach I take in this chapter is an attempt to render the notion of situated cognition (and situated word meaning) accessible and usable for readers from a variety of backgrounds while taking a particular perspective on it., My account is my version of a way to combine work on connectionism, concept formation, reflective practice, cultural models, and the sociology of science with an account of how children acquire the meanings of words and a sociocultural approach to language and literacy. The final goal, however, is to say something that is applicable to the practices and values of education in regard to multicultural classrooms and a multicultural world.

Game play is often complex and the underlying mechanisms are frequently opaque. In contrast, board games are simple. Their game play is fairly constrained and their core mechanisms are transparent enough to analyze. In this article, the authors seek to understand collaborative games. Because of their simplicity, they focus on board games. The authors present an analysis of collaborative games. In particular, they focus on Reiner Knizias LORDOFTHERINGS,considered bymanyto be the quintessential collaborative boardgame.Ouranalysis yields seven observations, four lessons, and three pitfalls, that game designers might consider useful for designing collaborative games. They reflect on the particular opportunities that computers have for the design of collaborative games as well as how some of the issues discussed apply to the case of computer games.},

@article{Porter2008,
abstract = {In 1979, a young associate professor at Harvard Business School published his first article for HBR, "How Competitive Forces Shape Strategy." In the years that followed, Michael Porter's explication of the five forces that determine the long-run profitability of any industry has shaped a generation of academic research and business practice. In this article, Porter undertakes a thorough reaffirmation and extension of his classic work of strategy formulation, which includes substantial new sections showing how to put the five forces analysis into practice. The five forces govern the profit structure of an industry by determining how the economic value it creates is apportioned. That value may be drained away through the rivalry among existing competitors, of course, but it can also be bargained away through the power of suppliers or the power of customers or be constrained by the threat of new entrants or the threat of substitutes. Strategy can be viewed as building defenses against the competitive forces or as finding a position in an industry where the forces are weaker. Changes in the strength of the forces signal changes in the competitive landscape critical to ongoing strategy formulation. In exploring the implications of the five forces framework, Porter explains why a fast-growing industry is not always a profitable one, how eliminating today's competitors through mergers and acquisitions can reduce an industry's profit potential, how government policies play a role by changing the relative strength of the forces, and how to use the forces to understand complements. He then shows how a company can influence the key forces in its industry to create a more favorable structure for itself or to expand the pie altogether. The five forces reveal why industry profitability is what it is. Only by understanding them can a company incorporate industry conditions into strategy.

abstract = {The structures of AHA! we have seen and the way in which they are created using the Concept Editor show a high resemblance with the AHAM reference model: You can create arbitrarily many concepts, each with an arbitrary set of attributes. The attributes cannot represent complex data types though, so AHA! is simpler than what the reference model allows. AHA! uses event-condition-action rules to perform user model updates. The order in which rules are executed is clear and sequential, which means there are no confluence problems. The rules may trigger each other and may trigger each other indefinitely. The concept editor can detect cycles but not every detected cycle indicates an infinite loop that is actually possible. The analysis is thus conservative. The connection between concepts and resources can be used for page selectors. In AHA! links can refer to resources or to concepts. In either case the AHA! engine will find a match between concept and resource. Through the casegroup feature it is possible to select conditionally included objects. This is part of the process of page construction. Creating an application through the Concept Editor is a lot of work because for every concept the attributes need to be created manually and every adaptation rule has to be created as a “specific adaptation rule”. This makes application creation very error-prone as well as laborious. The Graph Author Tool was created to solve these problems and to allow authoring to be done at a higher level of abstraction. The Graph Author knows about concept types, concept relationship types and offers “generic adaptation rules” that are associated with concept relationship types. The event-condition-action rules used by the AHA! engine are all generated automatically through a compiler that performs “rule instantiation”.},

@article{Cowley2008,
abstract = {In the domain of computer games, research into the interaction between player and game has centred on ‘enjoyment’, often drawing in particular on optimal experience research and Csikszentmihalyi’s ‘Flow theory’. Flow is a well-established construct for examining experience in any setting and its application to game-play is intuitive. Nevertheless, it's not immediately obvious how to translate between the flow construct and an operative description of game-play. Previous research has attempted this translation through analogy. In this article we propose a practical, integrated approach for analysis of the mechanics and aesthetics of game-play, which helps develop deeper insights into the capacity for flow within games. The relationship between player and game, characterized by learning and enjoyment, is central to our analysis. We begin by framing that relationship within Cowley’s user-system-experience (USE) model, and expand this into an information systems framework, which enables a practical mapping of flow onto game-play. We believe this approach enhances our understanding of a player's interaction with a game and provides useful insights for games’ researchers seeking to devise mechanisms to adapt game-play to individual players.},

abstract = {The gaming community currently uses an informal classification of games into genres such as first-person shooters, real-time strategy games, etc. While this classification is generally accepted, producing a more formal taxonomy of game types directly from data has several scholarly and commercial advantages. These include providing a basis for analysis of age- and gender-related data, statistically meaningful grouping in critical literature, improved game recommendations on retail websites, and better evaluation of a game's market potential before production. Mapping the mental space of game genres is challenging, both because it involves subjective evaluations and because there are many axes on which games can vary. We collected pairwise similarity metrics of games from game players through an online survey to build a large similarity matrix that is the projection of a highdimensional space representing the unknown and hypothetical true mental space of game genres. We then applied previous techniques in manifold learning and psychology to the problem of reconstructing the most significant dimensions into maps that can be meaningfully interpreted. We believe this is the first application of these techniques to games and one of the first to work with conceptual (instead of physical) data. The resulting maps arrange related games into spontaneously arising clusters that sometimes contradict current marketing genres. We analyze several of these clusters and propose both interpretations for these "true genres" as well as axes that game players appear to use in discriminating between them. Our initial results indicate that game players tend to primarily distinguish games not by traditional genres but instead by aesthetic and mechanics, which is closely related to how developers construct games.},

@article{Przybylski2009,
abstract = {The present research examined the background and consequences of different styles of engagement in video game play. Based on self-determination theory(1) and the dualistic model of passion,(2) the authors hypothesized that high levels of basic psychological need satisfaction would foster harmonious passion for video play, supporting the subjective sense that play is something one wants to do. It was also predicted that low levels of need satisfaction would promote obsessive passion for games and contribute to the feeling that game play is something one feels compelled to or has to do. It was expected, in turn, that passion for play would directly influence player outcomes closely tied to games, moderate links between play and well-being, and relate to overall levels of well-being as a function of basic need satisfaction. As expected, results showed that low levels of basic need satisfaction were associated with more obsessive passion, higher amounts of play, greater tension following play, and low game enjoyment, whereas high levels of need satisfaction did not predict hours of play but were associated with more harmonious passion, game enjoyment, and energy following play. Moderation analyses showed that high amounts of play related negatively to well-being only to the extent that players reported an obsessive passion and that the unique relations between passion and overall levels of player well-being were quite small once controlling for their basic need satisfaction in daily life. Discussion of the current findings focuses on their significance for understanding disordered play and the value of applying a theory-based approach to study motivation for virtual contexts.},

abstract = {Video games are an exciting part of new media. Although game play has been intensively studied, the underlying neurobiology is still poorly understood. Flow theory is a well-established model developed to describe subjective game experience. In 13 healthy male subjects, we acquired fMRI data during free play of a video game and analyzed brain activity based on the game content. In accordance with flow theory, we extracted the following factors from the game content: (i) balance between ability and challenge; (ii) concentration and focus; (iii) direct feedback of action results; (iv) clear goals; and (v) control over the situation/activity. We suggest that flow is characterized by specific neural activation patterns and that the latter can be assessed-at least partially-by content factors contributing to the emergence of flow. Each of the content factors was characterized by specific and distinguishable brain activation patterns, encompassing reward-related midbrain structures, as well as cognitive and sensorimotor networks. The activation of sensory and motor networks in the conjunction analyses underpinned the central role of simulation for flow experience. Flow factors can be validated with functional brain imaging which can improve the understanding of human emotions and motivational processes during media entertainment.},

Although studies to date have generally supported their value, most of the published investigations have methodological limitations. Critical process data are typically not collected, and unreliable student and teacher self-reports are heavily relied on in evaluating the educational efficacy of many games. To address these and other limitations, the authors have developed research software that can remotely and unobtrusively record screen activity during game play in classroom settings together with synchronized audio of player discussion. A field trial of this data collection system in which 42 college students were studied as they played a coursework-related Web-based learning game is described, and the article discusses how the trial outcomes concretely demonstrate the methodological advantages the tool offers researchers.},

abstract = {On-line games have been a highly profitable e-commerce application in recent years. The market value of on-line games is increasing markedly and number of players is rapidly growing. The reasons that people play on-line games is an important area of research. This study views on-line games as entertainment technology. However, while most past studies have focused on task-oriented technology, predictors of entertainment-oriented technology adoption have seldom been addressed. This study applies the technology acceptance model (TAM) that incorporates social influences and flow experience as belief-related constructs to predict users' acceptance of on-line games. The proposed model was empirically evaluated using survey data collected from 233 users about their perceptions of on-line games. Overall, the results reveal that social norms, attitude, and flow experience explain about 80\% of game playing. The implications of this study are discussed.},

annote = {More Americans now play video games than go to the movies (NPD Group, 2009). The meteoric rise in popularity of video games highlights the need for research approaches that can deepen our scientific understanding of video game engagement. This article advances a theory-based motivational model for examining and evaluating the ways by which video game engagement shapes psychological processes and influences well-being. Rooted in self-determination theory (Deci \& Ryan, 2000; Ryan \& Deci, 2000a), our approach suggests that both the appeal and well-being effects of video games are based in their potential to satisfy basic psychological needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness. We review recent empirical evidence applying this perspective to a number of topics including need satisfaction in games and short-term well-being, the motivational appeal of violent game content, motivational sources of postplay aggression, the antecedents and consequences of disordered patterns of game engagement, and the determinants and effects of immersion. Implications of this model for the future study of game motivation and the use of video games in interventions are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved).

Although typically seen as games, their strong social aspect suggests that they are a form of online communication tool, with which players interact to form friendships, create communities, and work together to accomplish a variety of goals. After an introduction to MMOs, this review explores how social aspects of the game imitate the real world in terms of choices that players make when interacting with others. Furthermore, player-to-player interactions are examined in terms of in-game group formation and how efficient communication is imperative for goal achievement. The review also explores how leadership skills learned in-game may be transferred to real-world scenarios. The reasons why people play MMOs are examined in terms of player motivations and how aspects of game play may have both positive and negative consequences for a player's well-being. The latter half of the review describes how MMOs are used as afterschool virtual teaching environments where students can use aspects of game play to learn, for example, leadership qualities. The review concludes with recommendations for using MMOs as virtual laboratories to explore aspects of human behavior. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved).

The pattern of performance on those mental rotation tasks revealed that skilled Tetris Players used the same mental rotation procedures as non-Tetris players, but when Tetris shapes were used, they executed them more quickly. In Experiment 2, non-Tetris players who received 12 hours of Tetris-playing experience did not differ from matched control students in pretest-to-posttest gains on tests of spatial ability. However, Tetris-experienced participants were more likely to use an alternative type of mental rotation for Tetris shapes than were Tetris-inexperienced participants.

As research and development initiatives proliferate, educational researchers might benefit by developing more grounded theories about them.

Players' understandings are developed through cycles of performance within the gameworlds, which instantiate particular theories of the world (ideological worlds). Players develop new identities both through game play and through the gaming communities in which these identities are enacted. Thus research that examines game-based learning needs to account for both kinds of interactions within the game-world and in broader social contexts.

 Good computer and video games like System Shock 2, Deus Ex, Pikmin, Rise of Nations, Neverwinter Nights, and Xenosaga: Episode 1 are learning machines. They get themselves learned and learned well, so that they get played long and hard by a great many people. This is how they and their designers survive and perpetuate themselves. If a game cannot be learned and even mastered at a certain level, it won.t get played by enough people, and the company that makes it will go broke. Good learning in games is a capitalist-driven Darwinian process of selection of the fittest. Of course, game designers could have solved their learning problems by making games shorter and easier, by dumbing them down, so to speak. But most gamers don.t want short and easy games. Thus, designers face and largely solve an intriguing educational dilemma, one also faced by schools and workplaces: how to get people, often young people, to learn and master something that is long and challenging.and enjoy it, to boot. },

Since GX is an important factor for the success of failure of a game, a formal classification of how to design for and evaluate GX is necessary. Using appropriate mechanisms for evaluation and mea-surement of GX allows the validation of good gameplay experiences. This paper presents an approach to formalize such evaluative methods and a roadmap for applying these mechanisms in the context of serious games. We first discuss related work of user experience (UX) and player experience models, based on which we propose a three-layer framework of GX. For each layer, a number of measurement methodologies are listed and our focus is put on physiological and technical metrics for game evaluation. Finally, we point out the potential use of this framework within the field of game-based learning and serious gaming for sports and health.},
